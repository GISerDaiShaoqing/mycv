Exploration of the impact of 30-m versus 500-m spatial resolution. Low fragmented mixed and industrial lands affect CO$_2$ emissions negatively. Low fragmented residential and public lands affect CO$_2$ emissions positively. Interactions of factors are weaker at a 30-m resolution than at a 500-m resolution.   Overview Besides the industrial production, transportation, local weather, and fossil fuel use, urban form is the factor that affects energy-related CO$_2$ emissions from human activities secondarily. The major forms of human activity affected by urban form are traffic and residential energy consumption/use emissions. After a wide examination of the relationship between urban higher fragmentation and CO$_2$ emissions, scholars found fragmentation of land use areas (i.e. areas designated for human activities or purposes) is associated with greater CO$_2$ emissions. However, the evidences might be biased by the uncertainties from the spatial distribution of emissions (also referred to “downscaling”, or “representation” uncertainty), the delineation of urban fragmentation landscape, and the analysis method, which ignores the spatial heterogeneity. Zuo et al. (2019) published the study in the Journal of Cleaner Production, which compared the relationships between urban form fragmentation and CO$_2$ emissions in an urban system through the analytic framework composed of the Pearson correlation analysis, geographically weighted regression (GWR), and geographical detector methods with the use of multi-source data to construct the CO$_2$ emissions maps. The analytical framework can be applied to CO$_2$ emissions research in urban agglomerations, megacities, and small towns.\nResults In terms of the GWR analysis, the coarse resolution resulted in: 1) positive coefficients of fragmentation metric becoming negative, and 2) greater absolute values of negative coefficients. As to the results of Geographical detector, single factor impact powers and interactions among fragmentation factors showed a weakening effect at R$_{30m}$, but a strengthening and weakening effect at R500m. However, there were common results observed in low-fragmented areas across different scales. That is, in low-fragmented mixed-function areas and industrial areas, the more fragmented the area was, the less the CO2 emission there would be. However, in low-fragmented residential, administrative and public service areas, the more fragmented the area was, the higher the CO$_2$ emission there would be. Therefore, the government should disperse the mixed function zones and industrial parcels with diverse types of land, and build the contiguous residential and public service land in the low fragmentation area of urban system.\nThe “Scale effect” has always been the hot topic in landscape ecology research. Although, there are many studies on the driving force of urban environmental problems by using landscape metrics. Most studies are carried out in regional, continental and global scales. However, in this study, we explored the relationship between the urban form fragmentation and CO$_2$ emissions in the city scale from the perspective of dual resolution sizes and summarized the research conclusions that can be used in urban internal management based on the analysis results of small towns. At the same time, the influence of scale effect and how to choose the appropriate scale were discussed in the discussion section.

In recent years, the increased demand for water resources, water pollution and serious waste of water resources due to the human activities result in the water shortage problems in some areas. Under this background, we used Ningbo region as an example to study the impacts of climate and land use/land cover (LULC) changes on water yield service. Firstly, the water yield module of the InVEST model was used to estimate the　water yield in the study area. Secondly, six scenarios were designed to analyze the impacts of climate and LULC changes on regional water yield. Finally, the contribution of two factors on water yield ecosystem services was quantified, including climate and LULC changes, and the formation mechanism was　discussed. The results show that:①From 2000 to 2015, the precipitation increased by 6.44% and the potential evapotranspiration decreased by 8.35% in　Ningbo region. Urbanization caused an increase of 120% in construction land area, and 22.37% in the cultivated land area. Under the combined effects of　climate and LULC changes, the average water yield increased by 10.91%. ②The impact of climate change on water yield service is more significant than that of LULC change. Specifically, the contribution of climate change to the water yield is as high as 97.56%, while the contribution of LULC change is only 2.44% in Ningbo region from 2000 to 2015. ③The water yield of urban ecosystem is the highest of any other types of ecosystem. The water yield of farmland ecosystem is higher than that of forest and grassland ecosystem. Therefore, the urbanization would increase the amount of water yield, however the returning farmland to forest or grassland would result in a decrease in water yield.","tags":["Ecological Modeling","Ecosystem Sevices","GIS"],"title":"The impacts of climate and land use/land cover changes on water yield service in Ningbo region(Chinese)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qing Yang","Tianyue Huang","Saige Wang","Jiashuo Li","**Shaoqing Dai**","Sebastian Wright","Yuxuan Wang","Huaiwu Peng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1555459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555459200,"objectID":"8ce92eb469ae772fdbfd39e39bff085b","permalink":"/publication/gis-pv-energy/","publishdate":"2019-04-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gis-pv-energy/","section":"publication","summary":"The achievement of temperature control target requires a low carbon transition of global energy structure. While China is actively promoting the implementation of large-scale PV generation technology, there is still a lack of scientific knowledge of the generation potential in China. To address this deficiency, this study builds a GIS-based model with 600 land conversion factors incorporated to accurately estimate the large-scale PV power generation potential in China. The results show a potential installed capacity of 1.41 × $10^5$ GW, corresponding to an annual power generation of 1.38874 × $10^{14}$ kWh or 21.4 times national electricity consumption in China 2016. If this potential were fully realized as a replacement for current fossil fuel-based power generation in China 2030, a reduction in China’s carbon intensity of 63–68% compared to 2005 would result, which is sufficient to meet China’s CO$_2$ emission reduction commitment. On a provincial level, while generation potential in Northwest and Inner Mongolia together account for 86% of the total, China's eight economically developed coastal provinces only account for 1%. To achieve a maximum large-scale PV scenario in China 2030, the capacity of inter-regional transmission grids from Northwest region and Inner Mongolia to the regions with insufficient potential should reach an approximate 300 GW. Our study could provide decision-makers with the precise information on large-scale PV power generation map of China, and optimizing low carbon strategies and inter-regional power transmission for achieving sustainable development.","tags":["GIS"],"title":"A GIS-based high spatial resolution assessment of large-scale PV generation potential in China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guoliang Yun","Yuanrong He","Yuantong Jiang","Panfeng Dou","**Shaoqing Dai**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548979200,"objectID":"159c1300c97e310d0f1af871cfc8c057","permalink":"/publication/yrt-pm25-drive-factors/","publishdate":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yrt-pm25-drive-factors/","section":"publication","summary":"High concentrations of PM2.5 are a primary cause of haze in the lower atmosphere.

We build up a multisource database (forest inventory, digital elevation models, population, and remote sensing imagery) on a uniform coordinate system to support research into the interactions that influence the STUFC. Landsat-5/8 Thermal Mapper images and meteorological data were used to retrieve the temporal and spatial distributions of land surface temperature. Ground observations, which included the forest management planning inventory and population density data, provided the factors that determine the STUFC spatial distribution on an urban scale. The use of a spatial statistical model (GeogDetector model) reveals the interaction mechanisms of STUFC. Although different environmental factors exert different influences on STUFC, in two periods with different hot spots and cold spots, the patch area and dominant tree species proved to be the main factors contributing to STUFC. The interaction between multiple environmental factors increased the STUFC, both linearly and nonlinearly. Strong interactions tended to occur between elevation and dominant species and were prevalent in either hot or cold spots in different years.

However, due to the limited availability of the sample lands and other space restrictions, the prediction accuracy of current AGB reference maps is associated with deviations, whose source may be related to the poorly understood effects of the spatial heterogeneity of multiple environmental factors (such as topography, soil, and forest structures) on the spatial distribution of AGB. To address these problems, we propose a method that combines machine learning and spatial statistics to determine the influence of biased samples by finding multiple environmental factors of regional covariates through the model algorithm. Subsequently, we consider an empirical case to quantitatively assess the prediction accuracy of the AGB reference map of an Eucalyptus plantation in Nanjing, China. In this case study, the biased AGB analysis data of 90 parse trees are selected and combined with regional forest resource inventory data to build three main machine-learning methods (support vector machine, random forest, and artificial neural network) and a spatial statistical analysis integration technology (a PBSHDE model). The results show that the evaluation indexes of the prediction accuracy (i.e., RMSE, MAE, and MRE) of the method that combines machine learning (random forest) and the PBSHDE model are significantly better than those for machine learning or the PBSHDE model individually. We conclude that the combination of spatial statistical analysis and machine learning can improve the accuracy AGB mapping in regions with biased samples and thus provide accurate predictions from AGB reference maps. Our research methods and conclusions may provide references for AGB remote-sensing mapping and simulation of ecological processes of different types of forests in various countries and tropical regions of the world.","tags":["Machine Learning","Spatial Statistics","GIS","Urban Carbon Cycle"],"title":"Improving the prediction accuracy of forest aboveground biomass benchmark map by integrating machine learning and spatial statistics","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Mapping direct carbon emissions at high-resolution in urban environments could help in the development of measures to mitigate carbon emissions through optimizing the layout of inner structures.\n","date":1527005700,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527005700,"objectID":"fe43f27dba8b0ed18a7033731049b145","permalink":"/talk/sa2018talks/","publishdate":"2018-05-22T16:15:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/sa2018talks/","section":"talk","summary":"This study gridded the CO$_2$ Emissions at the urban scale and quantified the uncertainties.","tags":["Urban Carbon Cycle","GIS","RS","Spatial Statistics"],"title":"High-Resolution Mapping of Direct CO$_2$ Emissions and Uncertainties at the Urban Scale","type":"talk"},{"authors":["**Shaoqing Dai**","Shudi Zuo","Yin Ren"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1526947200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1526947200,"objectID":"0c3647858c91213bc4f307e577c4020f","permalink":"/publication/high-resolution-co2-map-ei-meeting/","publishdate":"2018-05-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/high-resolution-co2-map-ei-meeting/","section":"publication","summary":"Mapping direct carbon emissions at high-resolution in urban environments could help in the development of measures to mitigate carbon emissions through optimizing the layout of inner structures.

Using Jinjiang City, China, as a case study, we applied this method to calculate the amount of carbon emissions in grids distributed across a city. This information was used to analyze emission uncertainties and its sources. The calculated emissions were allocated through the accurate spatial identification of three emission sectors and proxy data. Two different population spatialization methods were constructed in order to create 30 m and 500 m resolution grid maps. We designed four different Monte-Carlo simulation scenarios to analyze the uncertainties of the two maps. The results showed that the method developed here was suitable for delineating carbon emissions at the urban-scale. The 30 m resolution map showed that residential emissions were widely distributed, whereas industrial emissions were more concentrated, with the opposite trend being detected in the 500 m resolution map. Calculations of carbon inventory and spatial proxy had more impacts on the 30 m resolution map than on the 500 m resolution map. During the process of spatial superposition, the uncertainties from different sectors showed a nonlinear relationship, which was represented by smaller total uncertainties compared with the sum of uncertainties from the three emission sectors.

However, the approach has rarely been used to comprehensively analyze the individual and interactive influences of anthropogenic factors (e.g., population density, impervious surface percentage) and ecological factors (e.g., canopy density, stand age, and elevation) on PM2.5 concentrations. To do this, we used Landsat-8 images and meteorological data to retrieve quantitative data on the concentrations of particulates (PM2.5), then integrated a forest management planning inventory (FMPI), population density distribution data, meteorological data, and topographic data in a Geographic Information System database, and applied a spatial statistical analysis model to identify aggregated areas (hot spots and cold spots) of particulates in the urban area of Jinjiang city, China. A geographical detector model was used to analyze the individual and interactive influences of anthropogenic and ecological factors on PM2.5 concentrations. We found that particulate concentration hot spots are mainly distributed in urban centers and suburbs, while cold spots are mainly distributed in the suburbs and exurban region. Elevation was the dominant individual factor affecting PM2.5 concentrations, followed by dominant tree species and meteorological factors. A combination of human activities (e.g., population density, impervious surface percentage) and multiple ecological factors caused the dominant interactive effects, resulting in increased PM2.5 concentrations. Our study suggests that human activities and multiple ecological factors effect PM2.5 concentrations both individually and interactively.

In fact, the linear and nonlinear effects among the various factors resulted in the carbon emission spatial map. However, there is lack of the studies on the direct and indirect relations between the carbon emission and the city functional spatial form changes, which could not be reflected by the land use change. The linear strength and direction of the single factor could be calculated through the correlation and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) analysis, the nonlinear power of one factor and the interaction power of each two factors could be quantified by the Geodetector analysis. Therefore, we compared the landscape fragmentation metrics of the urban land cover and functional district patches to characterize the landscape form and then revealed the relations between the landscape fragmentation level and the direct the carbon emissions based on the three methods. The results showed that fragmentation decreased and the fragmented patches clustered at the coarser resolution. The direct CO$_2$ emission density and the population density increased when the fragmentation level aggregated. The correlation analysis indicated the weak linear relation between them. The spatial variation of GWR output indicated the fragmentation indicator (MESH) had the positive influence on the carbon emission located in the relatively high emission region, and the negative effects regions accounted for the small part of the area. The Geodetector which explores the nonlinear relation identified the DIVISION and MESH as the most powerful direct factor for the land cover patches, NP and PD for the functional district patches, and the interactions between fragmentation indicator (MESH) and urban sprawl metrics (PUA and DIS) had the greatly increased explanation powers on the urban carbon emission. Overall, this study provides a framework to understand the relation between the urban landscape fragmentation and the carbon emission for the low carbon city construction planning in the other cities.","tags":["Landscape Ecology","GIS","RS","Urban Carbon Cycle","Spatial Statistics"],"title":"Quantifying the linear and nonlinear relations between the urban form fragmentation and the carbon emission distribution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Shaoqing Dai**","Jiajia Li","Sudi Zuo","Yin Ren","Huixian Jiang"],"categories":null,"content":" Introduction The urban underlying surface heavily influences waterlogging. During the urbanization process, vegetation, water, and wetlands are replaced by impervious surfaces, including steel, cement, and other building materials. During the late-1990s, governments began to pay closer attention to the influence of urban underlying surfaces on storm water management. They started to develop low-impact development (LID) practices, which seek to use the landscape to control the water source and reduce the shock loads of storm water. Typical LID practices include green roofs, permeable pavements, and other green infrastructures. With the introduction of the Sponge City concept, China has gradually been introducing LID technology to improve the urban underlying surface and the spatial distribution of landscape.\nMost previous research of LID analyzed simulation experiments and storm water management at the small-scale level, whereas little analysis has been done at the urban level. Moreover, few studies have considered the influence of the natural green infrastructure (NGI), which refers to landscape that is good at receiving water. Here, we analyzed the urban central area of Fuzhou City, China, using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) data to divide the urban underlying surface into NGI and non-NGI landscapes. We extracted the impervious surface from the non-NGI landscape and used the precipitation-volumetric method to simulate waterlogging scenarios. We determined the area of rainwater submersion by simulation experiments, the change in the NGI landscape by overlaying images of the region, and the association between these features by data mining. Using the change in ecology indices, we ascertained the changing spatial patterns of the NGI landscape and used these findings to formulate suggestions for Sponge City planning in Fuzhou. Overall, our work combines three research themes, urban waterlogging, landscape ecology, and data mining, for a deep analysis of the relationship between the NGI landscape and storm runoff in an urban environment.\nMethods Flow chart of the study\nResult  Submerged areas were characterized by high population densities and high levels of human activity.

Numbers of people exposed to the submerged areas of scenarios 1 and 2 were 12,840 and 46,460 people, respectively.\nVisual representation of simulation results for scenario 1 and scenario 2\n Spatial association rule mining revealed a strong association between areas that were converted from NGI landscape and areas that were submerged in our simulations.

If an area was not subject to landscape conversion, then the probability that it would not be a submerged area was 99.2%.\nCONCLUSIONS Based on the results of this study, we derived the following conclusions:\n  Simulation analysis for the central urban area of Fuzhou City, assuming a 100-year storm with rainfall durations of 2 and 4 hours, resulted in submerged depths (areas) of 3.943 m (1.345 km2) and 4.055 m (6.032 km2), to which 12,840 and 46,460 people, respectively, were exposed. Submerged areas were found at locations of stronger human activity, which caused a higher risk of waterlogging. The area covered by NGI landscape in the central urban area of Fuzhou City decreased considerably and became more fragmented from 2006 to 2014. Urban residential area covers 40% of the converted landscape. Results of association rule mining showed that the submerged area has an important relationship with the NGI landscape conversion that, in turn, makes waterlogging frequent in urban areas. We used EIC to measure the change in landscape patterns and spatial distribution of the NGI landscape. Based on the results, we identified some ecological nodes and corridors and made some suggestions related to the Sponge City planning of Fuzhou City.

We determined the area of rainwater submersion by simulation experiments, the change in the NGI landscape by overlaying images of the region, and the association between these features by data mining. Using the change in ecology indices, we ascertained the changing spatial patterns of the NGI landscape and used these findings to formulate suggestions for Sponge City planning in Fuzhou. Overall, our work combines three research themes, urban waterlogging, landscape ecology, and data mining, for a deep analysis of the relationship between the NGI landscape and storm runoff in an urban environment.\n Submerged areas were characterized by high population densities and high levels of human activity.

About 50% of urban $CO_2$ emissions was attributed to urban forms, mixed land use, building types, and transportation networks. It is necessary to characterize the pixel-based distribution of urban direct $CO_2$ emissions accurately.
