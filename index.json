While various approaches to EEQ monitoring exist, they each have limitations and cannot be used universally. Moreover, previous studies lack detailed examinations of EEQ dynamics and its driving factors at national and local levels. Therefore, this study utilized a remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) to assess the EEQ of China from 2001 to 2021. Additionally, an emerging hot-spot analysis was conducted to study the spatial and temporal dynamics of the EEQ of China. The degree of influence of eight major drivers affecting EEQ was evaluated by a GeoDetector model. The results show that from 2001 to 2021, the mean RSEI values in China showed a fluctuating upward trend; the EEQ varied significantly in different regions of China, with a lower EEQ in the north and west and a higher EEQ in the northeast, east, and south in general. The spatio-temporal patterns of hot/cold spots in China were dominated by intensifying hot spots, persistent cold spots, and diminishing cold spots, with an area coverage of over 90%. The hot spots were concentrated to the east of the Hu Huanyong Line, while the cold spots were concentrated to its west. The oscillating hot/cold spots were located in the ecologically fragile agro-pastoral zone, next to the upper part of the Hu Huanyong Line. Natural forces have become the main driving force for changes in China’s EEQ, and precipitation and soil sand content were key variables affecting the EEQ. The interaction between these factors had a greater impact on the EEQ than individual factors.","tags":["GIS","RS","Spatial Statistics"],"title":"Long-Term Dynamic Monitoring and Driving Force Analysis of Eco-Environmental Quality in China","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1705487400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1705487400,"objectID":"766d64e93224b144589a247d5d9c961b","permalink":"https://gisersqdai.top/mycv/talk/iue2024talks/","publishdate":"2024-01-17T10:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/mycv/talk/iue2024talks/","section":"talk","summary":"To introduce some cases of my health geography studies.","tags":["Spatial-Temporal GIS Theory","GIS","RS","Spatial Statistics","Air Pollution Map","Urban Computing","Spatial Lifecourse Epidemiology"],"title":"Health geography studies based on spatial lifecourse epidemiology framework","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Chun Yin","Jiahang Liu","**Shaoqing Dai**","Bindong Sun"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1701734400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701734400,"objectID":"55fb64dd8f4ed0ddf766f9aceb939cfa","permalink":"https://gisersqdai.top/mycv/publication/tbs-mixed-land-use-well-being/","publishdate":"2023-12-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/mycv/publication/tbs-mixed-land-use-well-being/","section":"publication","summary":"Mixed land use (MLU) is recognized as a crucial means for urban planners to facilitate residents’ subjective well-being (SWB).

Based on a sample of 1028 survey participants in Shanghai from 2018 to 2019, a structural equation model is used to investigate the associations among MLU, social capital, and SWB in residential and workplace neighborhoods. We find that MLU has a negative and indirect association with SWB by decreasing social capital in residential neighborhoods, while it has a positive and indirect association with SWB by enhancing social capital in workplace neighborhoods with adjustments for other built environmental and sociodemographic attributes. That is, MLU has opposite associations with SWB mediated by social capital.

However, due to the numerous factors that influence urban carbon emissions and the complex paths of their effects, existing research findings are diverse and difficult to compare. This study constructed the local carbon emission zone (LCEZ) which links the highly urbanization morphology profiles and CO$_2$ emission intensity to favor summarizing the form characteristics for the low CO$_2$ emission control in new communities. The approach involved selecting six indicators from the perspectives of urban external morphology, internal characteristics, and development intensity, and using geographically weighted regression (GWR) to identify three key factors. The selected factors were divided into low(1) medium(2) and high(3) categories and were combined with each other to construct the LCEZ. The nonparametric test and GeoDetector model were used to test the difference and similarity of LCEZs, respectively. The results showed that 1) The impacts of functional mixing entropy (FME), building height (BH) and road density (RD) on residential and transport CO2$_2$ emissions (RTCE) were relatively large and positive; 2) The low- and medium-FME areas were the major types of LCEZ; 3) The area proportions of the low FME LCEZs in different population areas of the RTCE cold spot regions were the highest (81.84%–88.25%); 4) It is recommended that the morphological feature values of compact-low rise-low network (1-1-1), mid compact-low rise-mid network (1-1-2), compact-mid rise-low network (1-2-1) and mid compact-mid rise-mid network (1-2-2) were taken as the low CO$_2$ emission control of highly urbanized regions.","tags":["GIS","Spatial-Temporal GIS Theory","RS","Urban Carbon Cycle"],"title":"Local carbon emission zone construction in the highly urbanized regions: Application of residential and transport CO$_2$ emissions in Shanghai, China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Shaoqing Dai**","Wufan Zhao","Yanwen Wang","Xiao Huang","Zhidong Chen","Jinghan Lei","Alfred Stein","Peng Jia"],"categories":null,"content":" Proposed bikeability framework We construct the bikeability evaluation framework by combining the collected multi-source spatio-temporal big data (Figure 1 and Figure 2). The proposed bikeability evaluation framework contains four subindexes, i.e., safety, comfort, accessibility, and vitality, and thirteen influencing indicators, i.e., wind speed, road slope, precipitation, temperature, sky view index, green view index, trajectory sinuosity, air pollution, average speed of trajectory, public transportation accessibility, commercial accessibility, number of trajectory and crowdedness. All indicators used in our framework belong to objective and quantitative measurements.\nFigure 1. The proposed bikeability framework.\nFigure 2. Street view imagery semantic segmentation process, revised from Chen et al. (2018).\nSpatiotemporal analysis of bikeability We first present and discuss the results of four subindexes across Xiamen Island on a daily basis from December 21 to 25th, 2020 (Figure 3).\nFigure 3. The figures show the daily safety, comfort, accessibility, and vitality of Xiamen Island from top row to bottom row, where from left column to right column respectively represent the dates from 21 to 25th.\nThe calculation of the bikeability index requires assigning appropriate weights to each indicators. To determine these weights, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) on the 13 indicators. The PCA resulted in 6 components, providing a balance between a minimal number of components and reliable explained variance. The relationships between components and indicators are displayed in Figure 4.\nFigure 4. The PCA result for 13 indicators indicates correspondence between principal components and original indicators.\nThe temporal distribution of the bikeability index shows a fluctuation throughout the study period, as seen in Figure 5.The temporal distribution of the bikeability index shows a fluctuation throughout the study period, as seen in Fig. 8. On the 21st and 22nd, the average values were recorded as 0.236 and 0.233, respectively. On the 23rd, however, there was a noticeable drop in the bikeability index value, reaching a low of 0.098. Despite this decrease, the values rebounded to 0.188 and 0.185 on the 24th and 25th, respectively. This fluctuation in the bikeability index is mainly due to a rainfall event that occurred in Xiamen on the 23rd. The rainy conditions led to a significant decrease in the safety subindex, which in turn decreased the overall value of the bikeability index.\nFigure 5. Average bikeability of Xiamen Island on December 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th, 2020, the roads highlighted in red indicate lower levels of bikeability, whereas those in green indicate higher levels of bikeability.\nThe hourly pattern of the bikeability index reveals a different trend compared to the daily change (Fig. 8). As seen in Fig. 8, the hourly bikeability index values exhibit much less fluctuation. The value was recorded as 0.184 at 6:00 a.m. and then gradually increased, reaching its peak at 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. with values of 0.198 and 0.195, respectively. This increase was mainly due to an increase in the vitality subindex, as more people were using shared bicycles between 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. on working days. However, at 9:00 a.m., the value dropped to its lowest point at 0.17.\nFigure 6. Average bikeability of Xiamen Island at 6:00, 7:00, 8:00, and 9:00 a.m., the roads highlighted in red indicate lower levels of bikeability, whereas those in green indicate higher levels of bikeability.\nTo further validate our proposed index, we conducted a case study analysis in the central area of Xiamen CR, which is the middle continuous hotspot area. The location of this case study is the shared bicycle cycling hotspot at the intersection of Hubin Nanlu and Hubin Donglu, near the commercial center of Xiamen Wanxiangcheng, between 8:00–9:00 a.m. on December 21, 2020, as shown in Figure 7.\nFigure 7. Case study field validation.\nThe study area is centered around the Huarun commercial center, surrounded by a large residential area. During the morning hours, a substantial amount of shared bicycles are used in this region, contributing to a relatively high bikeability index. This highlights the significance of cycling routes in determining the level of bikeability.\nThe current cycling infrastructure falls short of supporting high-friendly cycling routes. For example, the road section near Hubin Middle School, which is located in a residential area and has a high demand for commuting, features a high density of shared bicycle stops, catering, shopping, and life services. The natural environment also favors cycling with low slopes, moderate wind speed, low precipitation, suitable temperature, overcast weather, and good air quality. Despite these favorable conditions, this section is congested during the morning rush hour due to a narrow non-motorized lane, slow average speed, and high volume of people commuting and going to school, resulting in low bikeability in this section despite high cycling activity.\nFurthermore, the demand for shared bicycles in hot spot regions is much higher, underscoring the importance of ensuring the availability of bicycles and easy accessibility. As shown in the figure, most road sections in the hot spot area have high densities of parking spots. However, there is a shortage of parking spots on the east side of Huarun Center, leading to a concentration of cyclists in other areas, causing congestion and potentially affecting commuting efficiency.\nThis case study showcases how our bikeability index takes into account the purpose of cycling and reflects cyclists’ preferred routes. Nonetheless, there remain disparities between the actual infrastructure, preferred routes, and regional conditions. By integrating the index system with real-time data, it is possible to provide suggestions for enhancing regional cycling conditions. The findings of this research can guide management departments and shared bicycle providers to improve facilities and offer optimal route planning for cyclists to avoid congestion and overcome difficulties in finding available bicycles. In conclusion, the bikeability index can provide comprehensive decision-making recommendations and advance the development of cycling-friendly cities.\nImplications for policy and practice The variability in the bikeability index across different segments presents an opportunity for transportation planners to enhance cycling infrastructure. Monitoring the spatiotemporal dynamics of bikeability can help identify potential environmental or infrastructure changes and their impact on the community’s level of bikeability. To ensure the relevance of the cycling friendliness index, case studies that incorporate additional infrastructure data are necessary for local comparison of bikeability results, enabling the proposal of landable solutions for varying infrastructure. For instance, the fusion analysis of parking spot electronic fence data and bikeability could expose discrepancies between regional cycling infrastructure and cyclists’ preferences, providing actionable recommendations to government departments and guiding users to cycle in a more bike-friendly manner.\n","date":1699401600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1699401600,"objectID":"e5f0468576b4fad27503a7422dc5151d","permalink":"https://gisersqdai.top/mycv/publication/jag-bikeability-multisource/","publishdate":"2023-11-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/mycv/publication/jag-bikeability-multisource/","section":"publication","summary":"we develop a bikeability evaluation framework by combining the collected multi-source spatio-temporal big data.","tags":["Spatial Lifecourse Epidemiology","GIS","Spatial Statistics","Street view images","Spatial-Temporal GIS Theory","Urban Computing"],"title":"Assessing spatiotemporal bikeability using multi-source geospatial big data: A case study of Xiamen, China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shujuan Yang","Bin Yu","Wanqi Yu","**Shaoqing Dai**","Chuanteng Feng","Ying Shao","Xing Zhao","Xiaoqing Li","Tianjing He","Peng Jia"],"categories":null,"content":"We develop a continuous, age-sex-ethnicity-specific Metabolic syndrome (MetS) score based on continuous measures of the five metabolic dysfunctions (waist circumference [WC], triglycerides [TG], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], mean arterial pressure [MAP], and fasting blood glucose [FBG]).\nFigure 1.

This giant-scale review was done to translate existing obesogenic environmental studies into evidence-based governance for fighting childhood obesity and promoting life-course health. Methods,Following a standard strategy of literature search and inclusion, all obesogenic environmental studies, published since the inception of the electronic databases, were reviewed to identify the evidence on associations with childhood obesity of 16 obesogenic environmental factors, including 10 built environmental factors or indices (ie, land-use mix, street connectivity, residential density, speed limit, urban sprawl, and access to green space, public transport, bike lanes, sidewalks, and neighbourhood aesthetics) and six food environmental factors (ie, access to convenience stores, supermarkets, grocery stores, full-service restaurants, fast-food restaurants, and fruit and vegetable markets). A meta-analysis was conducted to quantify the influence of each factor with sufficient studies on childhood obesity. Findings, A total of 24 155 search results were found and filtered, with 457 studies included in the analysis. All built environmental factors, except speed limit and urban sprawl, were negatively associated with childhood obesity by encouraging physical activity while discouraging sedentary behaviours; the access to all food venues, except convenience stores and fast-food restaurants, was negatively associated with childhood obesity by encouraging their healthy eating behaviours. There were some globally consistent associations, such as between greater access to fast-food restaurants in the neighbourhood and more fast-food consumption, between better access to bike lanes and more physical activity, between better access to sidewalks and reduced sedentary behaviours, and between greater access to green space and more physical activity and less TV or computer screen time. Interpretation, Findings have formed the unprecedentedly inclusive evidence for policy making and the establishment of the future research agenda regarding the obesogenic environment.

The results reveal that urban form indicators could explain about 45.9% of RTCE. The 2D building shape indicator has the second greatest positive impact as the external morphology indicator, which complicates the influence. The internal characteristics indicators have relatively strong influences than the development intensity indicators. For instance, the influence of functional mixed entropy (FME) is the greatest positive influence and decreases exponentially with FME increases. Therefore, cities with the FME lower than the threshold (0.28) should increase it appropriately, while cities with the FME around and larger than 0.28 should maintain and probably reduce it.","tags":["GIS","Spatial-Temporal GIS Theory","RS","Urban Carbon Cycle"],"title":"The importance of the functional mixed entropy for the explanation of residential and transport CO$_2$ emissions in the urban center of China","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1660833900,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660833900,"objectID":"6099d8e538fc29fcff728e0567d65d6c","permalink":"https://gisersqdai.top/mycv/talk/cpgis2022talks/","publishdate":"2022-08-18T14:45:00Z","relpermalink":"/mycv/talk/cpgis2022talks/","section":"talk","summary":"Using Gaode location based service data and travel time mapping produced by multi-sources geospatial data to investigate the effect of neighborhood boundaries on examining the associations between environmental factors and obesity.","tags":["Spatial Lifecourse Epidemiology","GIS","Spatial Statistics","Spatial-Temporal GIS Theory"],"title":"Do neighborhood boundaries matter for examining the associations between environmental factors and obesity","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Pengxin Zhang","Shuhan Yang","**Shaoqing Dai**","Darren How Jin Aik","Shujuan Yang","Peng Jia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1657670400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657670400,"objectID":"8207db71db7d6d3b4cdafc3b93be2878","permalink":"https://gisersqdai.top/mycv/publication/gh-covid-19-1/","publishdate":"2022-07-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/mycv/publication/gh-covid-19-1/","section":"publication","summary":"Although two years have passed since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, various variants are still rampant across the globe.

The global spatial distribution of Omicron was investigated by analyzing Global \u0026 Local Moran’s I and Getis- Ord General G. The spatial weight matrix was defined by combining K-Nearest neighbour and flight connectivity between countries. The results showed that the epidemic is relatively severe in Europe, countries with a high number of Omicron cases and incidence tended to be clustered spatially. In contrast, there are relatively fewer Omicron cases in Asia and Africa, with few hotspots identified. Furthermore, some noted spatial outliers, such as a lowvalue area surrounded by high-value areas, deserve special attention.

However, the existing top-down or bottom-up frameworks combining material flow analysis (MFA) and geographic information system (GIS) tend to underestimate both input and output of construction material flows due to insufficient descriptions of key processes in building construction and demolition. To address this limitation, this study identifies four important and complementary processes—construction, demolition, replacement, and maintenance, and integrates them into an improved framework to capture all material flows. We take Xiamen, a rapidly urbanizing city, as a case study to verify this framework. The results show that ∼40% of material inputs and ∼65% of outputs are underestimated by previous frameworks because they fail to capture material inputs in building maintenance and outputs in construction. These findings indicate a better estimation of such key flows in the modeling framework helps to accurately characterize building material metabolism. Based on systematic counting of material stocks and flows, the improved framework can help design effective policies for urban resource management by explicitly recognizing the spatiotemporal patterns and processes of material metabolism.","tags":["GIS","Spatial-Temporal GIS Theory","RS"],"title":"Quantifying urban mass gain and loss by a GIS-based material stocks and flows analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Weichao Wang","Xian Liu","Changwen Zhang","Fei Sheng","Shanjun Song","Penghui Li","**Shaoqing Dai**","Bin Wang","Dawei Lu","Luyao Zhang","Xuezhi Yang","Zhihong Zhang","Sijin Liu","Aiqian Zhang","Qian Liu","Guibin Jiang"],"categories":null,"content":"Figure 1.

The stable isotopic composition of elements provides a different dimension from the concentration and has been widely used as a tracer in geochemistry. In health research, stable isotopic analysis has also shown potential as a new diagnostic/prognostic tool, which is still in the nascent stage. Here we discovered that bladder cancer (BCa) could induce a significant variation in the ratio of natural copper isotopes (65Cu/63Cu) in the blood of patients relative to benign and healthy controls. Such inherent copper isotopic signatures permitted new insights into molecular mechanisms of copper imbalance underlying the carcinogenic process. More importantly, to enhance the diagnostic capability, a machine learning model was developed to classify BCa and non-BCa subjects based on two-dimensional copper signatures (copper isotopic composition and concentration in plasma and red blood cells) with a high sensitivity, high true negative rate, and low false positive rate. Our results demonstrated the promise of blood copper signatures combined with machine learning as a versatile tool for cancer research and potential clinical application.","tags":null,"title":"Identification of two-dimensional copper signatures in human blood for bladder cancer with machine learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Shaoqing Dai**","Xiaoman Zheng","Lei Gao","Chengdong Xu","Shudi Zuo","Qi Chen","Xiaohua Wei","Yin Ren"],"categories":null,"content":"Figure 1 Framework for estimating (a–c) the machine learning models, (d) the P-BSHADE model, and the three models that combine machine learning with the P-BSHADE model ((a,d), (b,d) and (c,d)).\nFigure 2 Prediction performance of the seven different models.

Moreover, it has caused ecological feedbacks at local scales (e.g., bi-directional transmission of COVID-19 between animals and humans, which could augment the COVID-19 risk in both animals and humans).\nReverse Zoonosis of COVID-19 Infection of animals with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from humans has highlighted the importance of understanding ‘reverse zoonosis’ (zooanthroponosis). Compared with three of the four possible routes of transmission for zoonotic diseases (i.e., animal–human, animal–animal, human–human), which have been well studied and confirmed, human–animal transmission lacks sufficient research due to the rare occurrence prior to COVID-19. Once such reverse zoonosis occurs it may cause the further evolution of viruses and affect the effectiveness of potential COVID-19 vaccines. Given the growing populations of livestock and other domesticated animals, increasing proximity between animals and humans in multiple settings (e.g., wet markets, home, and animal production facilities), and the relatively fewer resources assigned for animal testing during human outbreaks with zoonotic potential (particularly asymptomatic infections), new animals diseases may spread undetected. Proactive consideration of such reverse zoonosis enables the creation of management strategies. Therefore, reverse zoonoses require more rigorous and widespread macroecological and microbial studies.\nFigure 1 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Natural Infections of Pet, Zoo, and Livestock Animals as of 11 March 2021 Mapped onto Number of Confirmed Cases in the Human Population.\nBuilding Resilience against Future Reverse Zoonoses Reverse zoonoses may cause reduction and even extinction of the wild animal populations susceptible to viruses, which could destroy local biodiversity and ecological balance.\nPreventing reverse zoonoses also requires understanding pathogen feedback loops at the wildlife–livestock/pet–human interface. This will require greater capacities and commitments for pathogen discovery, mutation rate detection, and surveillance, in order to improve the prediction of pandemic potential, leading to management actions that interrupt possible pathways of spillover and transmission. Understanding these key evolutionary processes and ecological interactions calls for integrated virus–animal–human–environment surveillance systems. Spatial lifecourse epidemiology also provides a uniform analytical framework to link ecological surveillance to the national disease reporting system.\n","date":1620259200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620259200,"objectID":"8bfdf13edb7697c0d5e270de9adf2080","permalink":"https://gisersqdai.top/mycv/publication/tree-covid-19-2/","publishdate":"2021-05-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/mycv/publication/tree-covid-19-2/","section":"publication","summary":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic can cause reverse zoonoses (i.e., human–animal transmission of COVID-19).

This study proposes a systematic framework to obtain a gridded regional water security assessment, which reflects the regional natural resource, based on the index system derived from the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) model and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model. The results were applied to sustainable water management. Using 15 key cities in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region as a case study to apply the methodology, we found that the comprehensive water security was relatively high and high-value areas were widely distributed, accounting for about two-thirds of the study area. Low-value areas were mainly distributed in central and eastern regions, such as Shanghai, Suzhou, and Nanjing. There was evidence of a water resource shortage during the twelve-month period studied, particularly in August. The proportions of comprehensive water security in each administrative unit and the differences between simulated and target water quality could be used in the spatial planning and the exploration of payments for ecosystem services (PES) mechanism in county-level or smaller administrative units. Despite the premise requirement and the grid resolution problems of the InVEST model, it can be concluded that our assessment method proves capable of matching spatial and temporal differences in water supply and demand at a fine scale, and results can be used to supply useful information for urban management decision making.","tags":null,"title":"Refined water security assessment for sustainable water management: A case study of 15 key cities in the Yangtze River Delta, China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shujuan Yang","**Shaoqing Dai**","Yuling Huang","Peng Jia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1618185600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618185600,"objectID":"d647e02c677e9faa5d70437661bad375","permalink":"https://gisersqdai.top/mycv/publication/frph-covid-19-1/","publishdate":"2021-04-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/mycv/publication/frph-covid-19-1/","section":"publication","summary":"As the supply of nucleic acid detection kits for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is gradually approaching the demand for testing those with moderate or severe symptoms, even those with mild symptoms of the common cold in some countries, research interests in scientific communities have started to shift to those unidentified COVID-19 infections presenting mild or even no symptoms (i.e., asymptomatic COVID-19 infections).","tags":["Spatial Lifecourse Epidemiology"],"title":"Pitfalls in Modeling Asymptomatic COVID-19 Infection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lulu Song","**Shaoqing Dai**","Zhi Cao","Yupeng Liu","Weiqiang Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"Figure 1 Comparisons between predicted and statistics-based steel stocks in 2015 (a), 2016 (b), 2017 (c), and 2018 (d).

Prior studies have attempted to approximate steel stocks using nighttime light (NTL). Although proven to be a fast estimation technique, the accuracy of the NTL-based approach may be subject to several limitations, and it has not been used for projecting future steel stocks. To fill these gaps, we developed an aggregative downscaling model that fuses multiple large-scale spatial datasets, including gridded population, gross domestic product (GDP), and built-up area. We demonstrated the utility of this model by using it to map steel stocks in mainland China at 1 × 1 km resolution. Our results found the steel stocks increased from 12,873 $t/km^2$ to 33,027 $t/km^2$ during 1995–2015, and four steel stocks clusters (i.e., Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei agglomeration, Yangtze River Delta, Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and Chengdu-Chongqing metropolitan) possessed over 40% of the national total in 2015, revealing an unbalanced distribution of steel stocks across China. Moving forward, with the assumed population growth, GDP growth, and built-up area expansion, steel accumulation is expected to climb up to 64,636 t/km2 and cencentrate in larger cities in 2030, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou. Our analysis highlights the magnitude and pace at which steel resources have been and are expected to be accumulated above ground.

However, the complex interactions of the hydrometeorological, topographical and human activity factors need to be further explored.

Using Anhui Province in China, consisted of Huaibei plain, Jianghuai hilly and Wannan mountainous regions, we integrated multi-source data (6 meteorological, 3 hydrological, 2 topographic, and 9 socioeconomic variables) to explore the direct and interactive relationship between hydrological factors (quick flow, baseflow and local recharge) and other factors by combining the ecosystem model InVEST with spatial statistical analysis. The results showed hydrological factors had significant impact powers (q = 0.444 (Huaibei plain) for local recharge, 0.412 (Jianghuai hilly region) and 0.891 (Wannan mountainous region) for quick flow, respectively) on bacillary dysentery in different regions, but lost powers at provincial level. Land use and soil properties have created significant interactions with hydrological factors across Anhui province. Particularly, percentage of farmland in Anhui province can influence quick flow across Jianghuai, Wannan regions and the whole province, and it also has significant interactions with the baseflow and local recharge across the plain as well as the whole province. Percentage of urban areas had interactions with baseflow and local recharge in Jianghuai and Wannan regions. Additionally, baseflow and local recharge could be interacted with meteorological factors (e.g. temperature and wind speed), while these interactions varied in different regions. In conclusion, it was evident that hydrological factors had significant impacts on bacillary dysentery, and also interacted significantly with meteorological and socioeconomic factors.

The present workflow used four sub-modules based on Monte Carlo simulations and a bootstrap sampling method to analyze uncertainties, without other detailed open emission inventories. Two of the submodules obtained the corresponding uncertainty of each grid value, generated the uncertainty map caused by the gridded model, and the uncertainties for the sum of each cell (also referred to as propagated uncertainties caused by the model); the other submodules generated the uncertainty distribution maps based on the total emission estimations and spatial proxies (also referred to as propagated uncertainties caused by input).\nFigure 1 Analytic workflow of the uncertainty propagation in gridded $CO_2$ emission maps.

Uncertainties in total emission estimations aid the determination of emission reduction targets, the corresponding risks for cities and enterprises, and significant emission sources. Uncertainty maps could help to identify locations suitable for developing low-carbon communities. Fine-resolution (30 m) maps have a larger spatial variation in $CO_2$ emissions, which gives the fine-resolution maps a higher degree of uncertainty propagation. Furthermore, the uncertainties of gridded $CO_2$ emission maps, caused by inserting a random error into spatial proxies, were found to decrease after the gridding process. This can be explained by the “compensation of error” phenomenon, which may be attributed to the cancellation of the overestimated and underestimated values among the different sectors at the same grid.

It was found that temperature was a significant weather indicator in most included studies and was associated with a reduction of daily physical activity. Children living in high‐altitude areas were more likely to be shorter and heavier than their counterparts in low‐altitude areas. Findings of this study will contribute to helping multiple stakeholders, including policy makers and urban planners, and formulate health policies and interventions to mitigate the detrimental impact of the natural environment on childhood obesity.

The relationship between heavy metal speciation and char properties was characterized in detail to investigate the effects of co-pyrolysis. Results show that the addition of rice straw can decrease the ash content and increase thermal stability and pore structure of char due to its high organic content. Simultaneously, co-pyrolysis decreases heavy metal concentrations and enhances the transformation of Cr, Zn, and Cd to a more stable fraction, with higher alkalinity, aromaticity, and specific surface area of char. Moreover, the leaching toxicity of Zn with high content is decreased to below threshold values, and the potential ecological risk of char is reduced to the lowest level under the condition of 600 °C with a mixing proportion of 4:1.

Exploration of the impact of 30-m versus 500-m spatial resolution. Low fragmented mixed and industrial lands affect CO$_2$ emissions negatively. Low fragmented residential and public lands affect CO$_2$ emissions positively. Interactions of factors are weaker at a 30-m resolution than at a 500-m resolution.   Overview Besides the industrial production, transportation, local weather, and fossil fuel use, urban form is the factor that affects energy-related CO$_2$ emissions from human activities secondarily. The major forms of human activity affected by urban form are traffic and residential energy consumption/use emissions. After a wide examination of the relationship between urban higher fragmentation and CO$_2$ emissions, scholars found fragmentation of land use areas (i.e. areas designated for human activities or purposes) is associated with greater CO$_2$ emissions. However, the evidences might be biased by the uncertainties from the spatial distribution of emissions (also referred to “downscaling”, or “representation” uncertainty), the delineation of urban fragmentation landscape, and the analysis method, which ignores the spatial heterogeneity. Zuo et al. (2019) published the study in the Journal of Cleaner Production, which compared the relationships between urban form fragmentation and CO$_2$ emissions in an urban system through the analytic framework composed of the Pearson correlation analysis, geographically weighted regression (GWR), and geographical detector methods with the use of multi-source data to construct the CO$_2$ emissions maps. The analytical framework can be applied to CO$_2$ emissions research in urban agglomerations, megacities, and small towns.\nFigure 1 Analytical Framework\nResults In terms of the GWR analysis, the coarse resolution resulted in: 1) positive coefficients of fragmentation metric becoming negative, and 2) greater absolute values of negative coefficients. As to the results of Geographical detector, single factor impact powers and interactions among fragmentation factors showed a weakening effect at R$_{30m}$, but a strengthening and weakening effect at R500m. However, there were common results observed in low-fragmented areas across different scales. That is, in low-fragmented mixed-function areas and industrial areas, the more fragmented the area was, the less the CO2 emission there would be. However, in low-fragmented residential, administrative and public service areas, the more fragmented the area was, the higher the CO$_2$ emission there would be. Therefore, the government should disperse the mixed function zones and industrial parcels with diverse types of land, and build the contiguous residential and public service land in the low fragmentation area of urban system.\nFigure 2 Geographical detector results for fragmentation factors, PUA, and POID for CO$_2$ emissions from 4 sources.\nThe “Scale effect” has always been the hot topic in landscape ecology research.

In recent years, the increased demand for water resources, water pollution and serious waste of water resources due to the human activities result in the water shortage problems in some areas. Under this background, we used Ningbo region as an example to study the impacts of climate and land use/land cover (LULC) changes on water yield service. Firstly, the water yield module of the InVEST model was used to estimate the　water yield in the study area. Secondly, six scenarios were designed to analyze the impacts of climate and LULC changes on regional water yield. Finally, the contribution of two factors on water yield ecosystem services was quantified, including climate and LULC changes, and the formation mechanism was　discussed. The results show that:①From 2000 to 2015, the precipitation increased by 6.44% and the potential evapotranspiration decreased by 8.35% in　Ningbo region. Urbanization caused an increase of 120% in construction land area, and 22.37% in the cultivated land area. Under the combined effects of　climate and LULC changes, the average water yield increased by 10.91%. ②The impact of climate change on water yield service is more significant than that of LULC change. Specifically, the contribution of climate change to the water yield is as high as 97.56%, while the contribution of LULC change is only 2.44% in Ningbo region from 2000 to 2015. ③The water yield of urban ecosystem is the highest of any other types of ecosystem. The water yield of farmland ecosystem is higher than that of forest and grassland ecosystem. Therefore, the urbanization would increase the amount of water yield, however the returning farmland to forest or grassland would result in a decrease in water yield.","tags":["Ecological Modeling","Ecosystem Sevices","GIS"],"title":"The impacts of climate and land use/land cover changes on water yield service in Ningbo region(Chinese)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Shaoqing Dai**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1560384000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560384000,"objectID":"546150bd2fd8ae8371f3a7a98c5308a1","permalink":"https://gisersqdai.top/mycv/publication/masterthesis/","publishdate":"2019-06-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/mycv/publication/masterthesis/","section":"publication","summary":"Cities are typical sources of carbon and a focus of climate-change mitigation. Although there is great potential for reducing emissions in cities, constructing low-carbonemission cities under the carbon-emission reduction target of the 2016 Paris Agreement remains challenging as there is little scientific evidence for use by government decisionmakers. To solve this problem, we must understand the urban carbon-cycle process in greater detail and especially analyze spatiotemporal variations in carbon sources and sinks. Previous studies have focused on developing methods for estimating urban carbon sinks, such as remote sensing retrieval algorithms, a light-use efficiency model, and an ecological process model. In studies of urban carbon sources, night-light imagery has been widely used to construct regional-, national- and global-scale carbon emission maps. Additionally, open $CO_2$-emission products have provided some policy implications for decision-makers. Both the research and associated products have yielded fruitful results; however, the studies are independent and there are few that consider both the ecological process model and the $CO_2$-emission inventory. Therefore, we present a method that couples the ecological process model with an emission inventory to map the spatial distribution of carbon sources and sinks. We integrated multiple sources of data with different models and analytical methods to analyze the carbon balance status of Jinjiang city in 2013. The results indicated that a combined machine learning and spatial statistical approach may improve the accuracy of estimating the regional net primary productivity. Further, we upscaled the Biome-BGC model and assimilated the data to reduce the uncertainty of the upscaling process. Long-term observations in the data assimilation framework may improve the accuracy of the ecological process model’s simulation. Moreover, we may be able to devise a general hybrid approach (“globally downscaled” and ” bottom up” ) to create a gridded map showing $CO_2$ emissions. Comparisons between the resulting maps and other open products indicate a high accuracy in the maps. Finally, the results indicated that Jinjiang city was in a carbon-loss state in 2013 (that is, more carbon was emitted than stored). Carbon sources were distributed mainly in urban and suburban areas, whereas carbon sinks were distributed mainly in suburban areas. The population density, average temperature, and fragmentation of urban functional districts all had a significant effect on the urban carbon surplus. The population density negatively correlated with the carbon surplus. The average temperature and fragmentation of urban functional districts varied across the city. The results may inform policies on such issues as population migration, walkability, environmental management, construction, and urban renewal and thus help decision-makers mitigate carbon loss in cities.","tags":["GIS","Spatial Statistics","RS","Ecological Modeling","Landscape Ecology","Machine Learning","Urban Carbon Cycle","Urban Computing"],"title":"Creating a Carbon Source and Sink Map by Coupling an Ecological Process Model with an Emission Inventory to Study a Carbon Balance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qing Yang","Tianyue Huang","Saige Wang","Jiashuo Li","**Shaoqing Dai**","Sebastian Wright","Yuxuan Wang","Huaiwu Peng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1555459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555459200,"objectID":"8ce92eb469ae772fdbfd39e39bff085b","permalink":"https://gisersqdai.top/mycv/publication/gis-pv-energy/","publishdate":"2019-04-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/mycv/publication/gis-pv-energy/","section":"publication","summary":"The achievement of temperature control target requires a low carbon transition of global energy structure. While China is actively promoting the implementation of large-scale PV generation technology, there is still a lack of scientific knowledge of the generation potential in China. To address this deficiency, this study builds a GIS-based model with 600 land conversion factors incorporated to accurately estimate the large-scale PV power generation potential in China. The results show a potential installed capacity of 1.41 × $10^5$ GW, corresponding to an annual power generation of 1.38874 × $10^{14}$ kWh or 21.4 times national electricity consumption in China 2016. If this potential were fully realized as a replacement for current fossil fuel-based power generation in China 2030, a reduction in China’s carbon intensity of 63–68% compared to 2005 would result, which is sufficient to meet China’s CO$_2$ emission reduction commitment. On a provincial level, while generation potential in Northwest and Inner Mongolia together account for 86% of the total, China's eight economically developed coastal provinces only account for 1%. To achieve a maximum large-scale PV scenario in China 2030, the capacity of inter-regional transmission grids from Northwest region and Inner Mongolia to the regions with insufficient potential should reach an approximate 300 GW. Our study could provide decision-makers with the precise information on large-scale PV power generation map of China, and optimizing low carbon strategies and inter-regional power transmission for achieving sustainable development.","tags":["GIS","RS"],"title":"A GIS-based high spatial resolution assessment of large-scale PV generation potential in China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guoliang Yun","Yuanrong He","Yuantong Jiang","Panfeng Dou","**Shaoqing Dai**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548979200,"objectID":"159c1300c97e310d0f1af871cfc8c057","permalink":"https://gisersqdai.top/mycv/publication/yrt-pm25-drive-factors/","publishdate":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/mycv/publication/yrt-pm25-drive-factors/","section":"publication","summary":"High concentrations of PM2.5 are a primary cause of haze in the lower atmosphere.

We build up a multisource database (forest inventory, digital elevation models, population, and remote sensing imagery) on a uniform coordinate system to support research into the interactions that influence the STUFC. Landsat-5/8 Thermal Mapper images and meteorological data were used to retrieve the temporal and spatial distributions of land surface temperature. Ground observations, which included the forest management planning inventory and population density data, provided the factors that determine the STUFC spatial distribution on an urban scale. The use of a spatial statistical model (GeogDetector model) reveals the interaction mechanisms of STUFC. Although different environmental factors exert different influences on STUFC, in two periods with different hot spots and cold spots, the patch area and dominant tree species proved to be the main factors contributing to STUFC. The interaction between multiple environmental factors increased the STUFC, both linearly and nonlinearly. Strong interactions tended to occur between elevation and dominant species and were prevalent in either hot or cold spots in different years.

However, due to the limited availability of the sample lands and other space restrictions, the prediction accuracy of current AGB reference maps is associated with deviations, whose source may be related to the poorly understood effects of the spatial heterogeneity of multiple environmental factors (such as topography, soil, and forest structures) on the spatial distribution of AGB. To address these problems, we propose a method that combines machine learning and spatial statistics to determine the influence of biased samples by finding multiple environmental factors of regional covariates through the model algorithm. Subsequently, we consider an empirical case to quantitatively assess the prediction accuracy of the AGB reference map of an Eucalyptus plantation in Nanjing, China. In this case study, the biased AGB analysis data of 90 parse trees are selected and combined with regional forest resource inventory data to build three main machine-learning methods (support vector machine, random forest, and artificial neural network) and a spatial statistical analysis integration technology (a PBSHDE model). The results show that the evaluation indexes of the prediction accuracy (i.e., RMSE, MAE, and MRE) of the method that combines machine learning (random forest) and the PBSHDE model are significantly better than those for machine learning or the PBSHDE model individually. We conclude that the combination of spatial statistical analysis and machine learning can improve the accuracy AGB mapping in regions with biased samples and thus provide accurate predictions from AGB reference maps. Our research methods and conclusions may provide references for AGB remote-sensing mapping and simulation of ecological processes of different types of forests in various countries and tropical regions of the world.","tags":["Machine Learning","Spatial Statistics","GIS","Urban Carbon Cycle"],"title":"Improving the prediction accuracy of forest aboveground biomass benchmark map by integrating machine learning and spatial statistics","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Mapping direct carbon emissions at high-resolution in urban environments could help in the development of measures to mitigate carbon emissions through optimizing the layout of inner structures.\n","date":1527005700,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527005700,"objectID":"fe43f27dba8b0ed18a7033731049b145","permalink":"https://gisersqdai.top/mycv/talk/sa2018talks/","publishdate":"2018-05-22T16:15:00Z","relpermalink":"/mycv/talk/sa2018talks/","section":"talk","summary":"This study gridded the CO$_2$ Emissions at the urban scale and quantified the uncertainties.","tags":["Urban Carbon Cycle","GIS","RS","Spatial Statistics"],"title":"High-Resolution Mapping of Direct CO$_2$ Emissions and Uncertainties at the Urban Scale","type":"talk"},{"authors":["**Shaoqing Dai**","Shudi Zuo","Yin Ren"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1526947200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1526947200,"objectID":"0c3647858c91213bc4f307e577c4020f","permalink":"https://gisersqdai.top/mycv/publication/high-resolution-co2-map-ei-meeting/","publishdate":"2018-05-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/mycv/publication/high-resolution-co2-map-ei-meeting/","section":"publication","summary":"Mapping direct carbon emissions at high-resolution in urban environments could help in the development of measures to mitigate carbon emissions through optimizing the layout of inner structures.

Using Jinjiang City, China, as a case study, we applied this method to calculate the amount of carbon emissions in grids distributed across a city. This information was used to analyze emission uncertainties and its sources. The calculated emissions were allocated through the accurate spatial identification of three emission sectors and proxy data. Two different population spatialization methods were constructed in order to create 30 m and 500 m resolution grid maps. We designed four different Monte-Carlo simulation scenarios to analyze the uncertainties of the two maps. The results showed that the method developed here was suitable for delineating carbon emissions at the urban-scale. The 30 m resolution map showed that residential emissions were widely distributed, whereas industrial emissions were more concentrated, with the opposite trend being detected in the 500 m resolution map. Calculations of carbon inventory and spatial proxy had more impacts on the 30 m resolution map than on the 500 m resolution map. During the process of spatial superposition, the uncertainties from different sectors showed a nonlinear relationship, which was represented by smaller total uncertainties compared with the sum of uncertainties from the three emission sectors.

However, the approach has rarely been used to comprehensively analyze the individual and interactive influences of anthropogenic factors (e.g., population density, impervious surface percentage) and ecological factors (e.g., canopy density, stand age, and elevation) on PM2.5 concentrations. To do this, we used Landsat-8 images and meteorological data to retrieve quantitative data on the concentrations of particulates (PM2.5), then integrated a forest management planning inventory (FMPI), population density distribution data, meteorological data, and topographic data in a Geographic Information System database, and applied a spatial statistical analysis model to identify aggregated areas (hot spots and cold spots) of particulates in the urban area of Jinjiang city, China. A geographical detector model was used to analyze the individual and interactive influences of anthropogenic and ecological factors on PM2.5 concentrations. We found that particulate concentration hot spots are mainly distributed in urban centers and suburbs, while cold spots are mainly distributed in the suburbs and exurban region. Elevation was the dominant individual factor affecting PM2.5 concentrations, followed by dominant tree species and meteorological factors. A combination of human activities (e.g., population density, impervious surface percentage) and multiple ecological factors caused the dominant interactive effects, resulting in increased PM2.5 concentrations. Our study suggests that human activities and multiple ecological factors effect PM2.5 concentrations both individually and interactively. We conclude that in order to reveal the direct and indirect effects of human activities and multiple factors on PM2.5 concentrations in urban forests, quantification of fusion satellite data and spatial statistical methods should be conducted in urban areas.","tags":["Spatial Statistics","GIS","RS"],"title":"Individual and Interactive Influences of Anthropogenic and Ecological Factors on Forest PM2.5 Concentrations at an Urban Scale","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qin Ye","Gang Zeng","**Shaoqing Dai**","Fenglong Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1518652800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1518652800,"objectID":"28ff13a44bcfbbc9c1dde2b15e902686","permalink":"https://gisersqdai.top/mycv/publication/energy-conservation-and-emissions-reduction-innovation-journal-cn/","publishdate":"2018-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/mycv/publication/energy-conservation-and-emissions-reduction-innovation-journal-cn/","section":"publication","summary":"The impact that environmental regulation has on technology innovation is a hot spot in currently research which already has a large number of empirical studies based on Porter Hypothesis． However there are still controversies in academia about the establishment of weak Porter Hypothesis and narrow Porter Hypothesis． Based on the panel data of application for patent of emission reduction technology of 285 prefectural-level municipalities during 2008 － 2014， comprehensive energy price， and pollutant emission etc． ， we use mixed regression model and systematic GMM method respectively to study the impact that market-oriented policy tool and command-and-control policy tool have on China energy conservation and emission reduction technology innovation． The results show that the environmental regulation hinders the technological innovation at sight however promoting it after lag one issue． So the establishment of weak Porter Hypothesis has time constraints． The lag command-and-control policy tool plays a more positive role in promoting technological innovation than market-oriented policy tool， so narrow Porter Hypothesis couldn’t work． The reason is that the main participants of China energy-saving and emission reduction technology innovation are state-owned enterprises and public institutions．Regionally speaking， the impact which command-and-control policy tool has on technological innovation at sight is non-significant in eastern， central and western regions; market-oriented policy tool has negative effect． And market-oriented policy tool in central region has strongest negative effect， it will diminish in eastern region and become weakest in western region． This is related to regional energy consumption level and the market economic vitality． The research firstly finds that the narrow Porter Hypothesis is not suitable for China emission reduction innovation while the weak Porter Hypothesis works， secondly it provides reference for the formulation of regional energy saving and emission reduction policies.","tags":["GIS","Spatial Statistics"],"title":"Research on the effects of different policy tools on China’s emissions reduction innovation(Chinese)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":" Dec. 5, 2023: We published a paper on the associations between mixed land use(MLU) and subjective well-being(SWB).

However, there are still controversies in academia about the establishment of “weak” and “narrow” versions of PH. Based on the panel data of application for patent of energy conservation and emission reduction (ECER) technology of Chinese city scale during 2008–2014, comprehensive energy price, pollutant emission, etc., mixed regression model and systematic generalized method of moments method were adopted, respectively, to study the impact of market-oriented and command-and-control policy tool on China’s ECER technology innovation. The results show that the environmental regulation hindered the technological innovation in the immediate phase; however, it turned out to be positive in the first-lag phase. Hence, the establishment of “weak” PH is time-bounded. The command-and-control policy tool played a more positive role in promoting technological innovation in the first-lag phase than market-oriented policy tool. Therefore, “narrow” PH is not tenable. The reason is that the main participants of China’s ECER technology innovation are state-owned companies and public institutions. Regionally speaking, the impact which command-and-control policy tool has on technological innovation at sight was non-significant in the eastern, the central, and the western regions of China whilst market-oriented policy tool had a negative effect. And market-oriented policy tool in the central region had strongest negative effect, which would diminish in the eastern region and become weakest in the western region. This was related to regional energy consumption level and the market economic vitality.","tags":["GIS","Spatial Statistics"],"title":"Research on the effects of command-and-control and market-oriented policy tools on China’s energy conservation and emissions reduction innovation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Shaoqing Dai**","Jiajia Li","Sudi Zuo","Yin Ren","Huixian Jiang"],"categories":null,"content":" Introduction The urban underlying surface heavily influences waterlogging. During the urbanization process, vegetation, water, and wetlands are replaced by impervious surfaces, including steel, cement, and other building materials. During the late-1990s, governments began to pay closer attention to the influence of urban underlying surfaces on storm water management. They started to develop low-impact development (LID) practices, which seek to use the landscape to control the water source and reduce the shock loads of storm water. Typical LID practices include green roofs, permeable pavements, and other green infrastructures. With the introduction of the Sponge City concept, China has gradually been introducing LID technology to improve the urban underlying surface and the spatial distribution of landscape.\nMost previous research of LID analyzed simulation experiments and storm water management at the small-scale level, whereas little analysis has been done at the urban level. Moreover, few studies have considered the influence of the natural green infrastructure (NGI), which refers to landscape that is good at receiving water. Here, we analyzed the urban central area of Fuzhou City, China, using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) data to divide the urban underlying surface into NGI and non-NGI landscapes. We extracted the impervious surface from the non-NGI landscape and used the precipitation-volumetric method to simulate waterlogging scenarios. We determined the area of rainwater submersion by simulation experiments, the change in the NGI landscape by overlaying images of the region, and the association between these features by data mining. Using the change in ecology indices, we ascertained the changing spatial patterns of the NGI landscape and used these findings to formulate suggestions for Sponge City planning in Fuzhou. Overall, our work combines three research themes, urban waterlogging, landscape ecology, and data mining, for a deep analysis of the relationship between the NGI landscape and storm runoff in an urban environment.\nMethods Figure 1 Flow chart of the study\nResult  Submerged areas were characterized by high population densities and high levels of human activity.

Numbers of people exposed to the submerged areas of scenarios 1 and 2 were 12,840 and 46,460 people, respectively.\nFigure 2 Visual representation of simulation results for scenario 1 and scenario 2\n Spatial association rule mining revealed a strong association between areas that were converted from NGI landscape and areas that were submerged in our simulations.

If an area was not subject to landscape conversion, then the probability that it would not be a submerged area was 99.2%.\nCONCLUSIONS Based on the results of this study, we derived the following conclusions:\n  Simulation analysis for the central urban area of Fuzhou City, assuming a 100-year storm with rainfall durations of 2 and 4 hours, resulted in submerged depths (areas) of 3.943 m (1.345 km2) and 4.055 m (6.032 km2), to which 12,840 and 46,460 people, respectively, were exposed. Submerged areas were found at locations of stronger human activity, which caused a higher risk of waterlogging. The area covered by NGI landscape in the central urban area of Fuzhou City decreased considerably and became more fragmented from 2006 to 2014. Urban residential area covers 40% of the converted landscape. Results of association rule mining showed that the submerged area has an important relationship with the NGI landscape conversion that, in turn, makes waterlogging frequent in urban areas. We used EIC to measure the change in landscape patterns and spatial distribution of the NGI landscape. Based on the results, we identified some ecological nodes and corridors and made some suggestions related to the Sponge City planning of Fuzhou City.

Although there is great potential for reducing emissions in cities, constructing low-carbonemission cities under the carbon-emission reduction target of the 2016 Paris Agreement remains challenging as there is little scientific evidence for use by government decisionmakers. To solve this problem, we must understand the urban carbon-cycle process in greater detail and especially analyze spatiotemporal variations in carbon sources and sinks.\n1 Carbon sink map The forest is the only exact carbon sink. How to map the accurate carbon sink maps? Firstly, we propose herein a low-cost method that combines machine learning and spatial statistics to construct a regional biomass map from non-representative sample units. Secondly, we scaled up an ecological process model to obtain the spatial distribution of regional biomass. Finally, we used some data assimilation technology by these data.\nFigure 1 Framework for estimating (a–c) the machine learning models, (d) the P-BSHADE model, and the three models that combine machine learning with the P-BSHADE model ((a,d), (b,d) and (c,d)).\n【动态】城市环境研究所在提升森林样地水平地上生物量的估算精度方面取得进展\nFigure 2.

About 50% of urban $CO_2$ emissions was attributed to urban forms, mixed land use, building types, and transportation networks. It is necessary to characterize the pixel-based distribution of urban direct $CO_2$ emissions accurately. But large uncertainties was found at the urban scale, it\u0026rsquo;s important to analyze the uncertainties of $CO_2$ emissions gridded map at the urban scale. Besides, exlporing the relationship between $CO_2$ emissions and urban form is useful for planning.\nWe used a general hybrid approach based on global downscaled and bottom-up elements to produce the CO$_2$ emissions gridded maps, identitfied the urban functional districts map, and generated the city-scale effect related impact factors. All the maps were included in a spatial database. Detailed information can see it.\nFigure 3. Comparison between our $CO_2$ emission griddedmap and other inventories\nWe assessed the uncertainty of CO$_2$ emissions gridded maps during the gridded proceess using our proposed analytic workflow and published in Remote Sensing. Detailed information can see it.\nFigure 3. Graphical abstract\nFigure 4.

We compared the relationships between urban form fragmentation and CO$_2$ emissions in an urban system through the analytic framework composed of the Pearson correlation analysis, geographically weighted regression (GWR), and geographical detector methods with the use of multi-source data to construct the CO$_2$ emissions maps. The analytical framework can be applied to CO$_2$ emissions research in urban agglomerations, megacities, and small towns.\nFigure 6. Analytical Framework\nFigure 7. Geographical detector results for fragmentation factors, PUA, and POID for CO$_2$ emissions from 4 sources.\nThis research uses remote sensing data and downscaling interpolation to generate residential and transport (RTCE) maps in 130 m spatial resolution of urban center regions from 31 major cities in China, then investigates the relationship between 3 types of urban form indicators (Internal characteristics, external morphology, and development intensity) and RTCE through Geographical Weighted Regression method. The results reveal that urban form indicators could explain about 45.9% of RTCE. The 2D building shape indicator has the second greatest positive impact as the external morphology indicator, which complicates the influence. The internal characteristics indicators have relatively strong influences than the development intensity indicators. For instance, the influence of functional mixed entropy (FME) is the greatest positive influence and decreases exponentially with FME increases.\nFigure 8. The relation between the functional mixed entropy and the GWR mean regression coefficients in 31 cities. The red, yellow, light blue and blue dot represents the Type Ⅰ, Ⅱ, Ⅲ and Ⅳ city, respectively. The numbers follow the city names represent the size order of the urban area. Point A, B and C are hypothetical.\n4 Local carbon emission zone construction We constructed the local carbon emission zone (LCEZ) which links the highly urbanization morphology profiles and CO$_2$ emission intensity to favor summarizing the form characteristics for the low CO$_2$ emission control in new communities.\nFigure 9.

We developed an aggregative downscaling model that fuses multiple large-scale spatial datasets, including gridded population, gross domestic product (GDP), and built-up area. We demonstrated the utility of this model by using it to map steel stocks in mainland China at 1 × 1 km resolution. Our results found the steel stocks increased from 12,873 $t/km^2$ to 33,027 $t/km^2$ during 1995–2015, and four steel stocks clusters (i.e., Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei agglomeration, Yangtze River Delta, Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and Chengdu-Chongqing metropolitan) possessed over 40% of the national total in 2015, revealing an unbalanced distribution of steel stocks across China.\nFigure 2.
