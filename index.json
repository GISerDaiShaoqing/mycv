However, the association between the natural environment and childhood obesity has received too little scholarly attention. This study reviewed the literature published before 1 January 2019, which described associations between a full range of natural environmental factors (e.g., rainfall, temperature, sunlight, natural disasters, flood and drought) and weight‐related behaviours and childhood obesity. Five cross‐sectional studies and one longitudinal study were identified. Measures of natural environmental factors varied across six included studies, falling into five broad categories, weather conditions, altitude, natural disaster risk, air quality and day length. It was found that temperature was a significant weather indicator in most included studies and was associated with a reduction of daily physical activity. Children living in high‐altitude areas were more likely to be shorter and heavier than their counterparts in low‐altitude areas. Findings of this study will contribute to helping multiple stakeholders, including policy makers and urban planners, and formulate health policies and interventions to mitigate the detrimental impact of the natural environment on childhood obesity. More longitudinal studies should be designed to confirm these effects and explore the potential health effects of more natural environmental factors.","tags":["Spatial Lifecourse Epidemiology","Obesity"],"title":"Natural environment and childhood obesity: A systematic review","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaofang Pan","Hu Li","Lixin Zhao","Xiaoru Yang","Jianqiang Su","**Shaoqing Dai**","Jing Ning","Chunxing Li","Guanjing Cai","Gefu Zhu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1596931200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596931200,"objectID":"4404f008ab4978cd5e9b9909e8c89d46","permalink":"https://gisersqdai.top/mycv/publication/jclp-responserice/","publishdate":"2020-08-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/mycv/publication/jclp-responserice/","section":"publication","summary":"Methanogenesis and syntrophy are the most important microbial metabolic processes for the anaerobic decomposition of organic matters in paddy soils. However, the diversity and abundance of syntrophic communities and their ecological determinants remain largely unexplored. In this study, we aimed to unravel the impacts of soil type and rice phenology on both syntrophic and methanogenic communities. The relative abundances of syntrophic bacteria and methanogenic archaea were significantly affected by soil type and rice growth stages, with 0.39 - 1.66% and 1.68 - 3.95% for syntrophic bacteria and 0.49 - 6.04% and 9.29 - 13.69% for methanogenic archaea, respectively. Besides, the populations of short-chain fatty acid-degrading syntrophs (SFAS) varied across soil types (range 8.21 × $10^6$ - 7.83 × $10^7$ 16S rRNA gene copies $g^{-1}$ dry soil) and rice growth stages (range 2.27 × $10^7$ - 3.88 × $10^7$ 16S rRNA gene copies $g^{-1}$ dry soil). Moreover, the populations of syntrophic propionate-oxidizing bacteria were 1.2 - 6.2 times higher than those of butyrate-oxidizing bacteria in the 10 paddy soils during the off-rice season, indicating that propionate is the main intermediate product during anaerobic decomposition of organic matter. However, Syntrophomonas was the most dominant throughout the rice growing season, implying that syntrophic pathways may vary between off-rice and growing seasons.

The relationship between heavy metal speciation and char properties was characterized in detail to investigate the effects of co-pyrolysis. Results show that the addition of rice straw can decrease the ash content and increase thermal stability and pore structure of char due to its high organic content. Simultaneously, co-pyrolysis decreases heavy metal concentrations and enhances the transformation of Cr, Zn, and Cd to a more stable fraction, with higher alkalinity, aromaticity, and specific surface area of char. Moreover, the leaching toxicity of Zn with high content is decreased to below threshold values, and the potential ecological risk of char is reduced to the lowest level under the condition of 600 °C with a mixing proportion of 4:1.

Exploration of the impact of 30-m versus 500-m spatial resolution. Low fragmented mixed and industrial lands affect CO$_2$ emissions negatively. Low fragmented residential and public lands affect CO$_2$ emissions positively. Interactions of factors are weaker at a 30-m resolution than at a 500-m resolution.   Overview Besides the industrial production, transportation, local weather, and fossil fuel use, urban form is the factor that affects energy-related CO$_2$ emissions from human activities secondarily. The major forms of human activity affected by urban form are traffic and residential energy consumption/use emissions. After a wide examination of the relationship between urban higher fragmentation and CO$_2$ emissions, scholars found fragmentation of land use areas (i.e. areas designated for human activities or purposes) is associated with greater CO$_2$ emissions. However, the evidences might be biased by the uncertainties from the spatial distribution of emissions (also referred to “downscaling”, or “representation” uncertainty), the delineation of urban fragmentation landscape, and the analysis method, which ignores the spatial heterogeneity. Zuo et al. (2019) published the study in the Journal of Cleaner Production, which compared the relationships between urban form fragmentation and CO$_2$ emissions in an urban system through the analytic framework composed of the Pearson correlation analysis, geographically weighted regression (GWR), and geographical detector methods with the use of multi-source data to construct the CO$_2$ emissions maps. The analytical framework can be applied to CO$_2$ emissions research in urban agglomerations, megacities, and small towns.\nResults In terms of the GWR analysis, the coarse resolution resulted in: 1) positive coefficients of fragmentation metric becoming negative, and 2) greater absolute values of negative coefficients. As to the results of Geographical detector, single factor impact powers and interactions among fragmentation factors showed a weakening effect at R$_{30m}$, but a strengthening and weakening effect at R500m. However, there were common results observed in low-fragmented areas across different scales. That is, in low-fragmented mixed-function areas and industrial areas, the more fragmented the area was, the less the CO2 emission there would be. However, in low-fragmented residential, administrative and public service areas, the more fragmented the area was, the higher the CO$_2$ emission there would be. Therefore, the government should disperse the mixed function zones and industrial parcels with diverse types of land, and build the contiguous residential and public service land in the low fragmentation area of urban system.\nThe “Scale effect” has always been the hot topic in landscape ecology research. Although, there are many studies on the driving force of urban environmental problems by using landscape metrics. Most studies are carried out in regional, continental and global scales. However, in this study, we explored the relationship between the urban form fragmentation and CO$_2$ emissions in the city scale from the perspective of dual resolution sizes and summarized the research conclusions that can be used in urban internal management based on the analysis results of small towns. At the same time, the influence of scale effect and how to choose the appropriate scale were discussed in the discussion section.

In recent years, the increased demand for water resources, water pollution and serious waste of water resources due to the human activities result in the water shortage problems in some areas. Under this background, we used Ningbo region as an example to study the impacts of climate and land use/land cover (LULC) changes on water yield service. Firstly, the water yield module of the InVEST model was used to estimate the　water yield in the study area. Secondly, six scenarios were designed to analyze the impacts of climate and LULC changes on regional water yield. Finally, the contribution of two factors on water yield ecosystem services was quantified, including climate and LULC changes, and the formation mechanism was　discussed. The results show that:①From 2000 to 2015, the precipitation increased by 6.44% and the potential evapotranspiration decreased by 8.35% in　Ningbo region. Urbanization caused an increase of 120% in construction land area, and 22.37% in the cultivated land area. Under the combined effects of　climate and LULC changes, the average water yield increased by 10.91%. ②The impact of climate change on water yield service is more significant than that of LULC change. Specifically, the contribution of climate change to the water yield is as high as 97.56%, while the contribution of LULC change is only 2.44% in Ningbo region from 2000 to 2015. ③The water yield of urban ecosystem is the highest of any other types of ecosystem. The water yield of farmland ecosystem is higher than that of forest and grassland ecosystem. Therefore, the urbanization would increase the amount of water yield, however the returning farmland to forest or grassland would result in a decrease in water yield.","tags":["Ecological Modeling","Ecosystem Sevices","GIS"],"title":"The impacts of climate and land use/land cover changes on water yield service in Ningbo region(Chinese)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Shaoqing Dai**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1560384000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560384000,"objectID":"546150bd2fd8ae8371f3a7a98c5308a1","permalink":"https://gisersqdai.top/mycv/publication/masterthesis/","publishdate":"2019-06-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/mycv/publication/masterthesis/","section":"publication","summary":"Cities are typical sources of carbon and a focus of climate-change mitigation. Although there is great potential for reducing emissions in cities, constructing low-carbonemission cities under the carbon-emission reduction target of the 2016 Paris Agreement remains challenging as there is little scientific evidence for use by government decisionmakers. To solve this problem, we must understand the urban carbon-cycle process in greater detail and especially analyze spatiotemporal variations in carbon sources and sinks. Previous studies have focused on developing methods for estimating urban carbon sinks, such as remote sensing retrieval algorithms, a light-use efficiency model, and an ecological process model. In studies of urban carbon sources, night-light imagery has been widely used to construct regional-, national- and global-scale carbon emission maps. Additionally, open $CO_2$-emission products have provided some policy implications for decision-makers. Both the research and associated products have yielded fruitful results; however, the studies are independent and there are few that consider both the ecological process model and the $CO_2$-emission inventory. Therefore, we present a method that couples the ecological process model with an emission inventory to map the spatial distribution of carbon sources and sinks. We integrated multiple sources of data with different models and analytical methods to analyze the carbon balance status of Jinjiang city in 2013. The results indicated that a combined machine learning and spatial statistical approach may improve the accuracy of estimating the regional net primary productivity. Further, we upscaled the Biome-BGC model and assimilated the data to reduce the uncertainty of the upscaling process. Long-term observations in the data assimilation framework may improve the accuracy of the ecological process model’s simulation. Moreover, we may be able to devise a general hybrid approach (“globally downscaled” and ” bottom up” ) to create a gridded map showing $CO_2$ emissions. Comparisons between the resulting maps and other open products indicate a high accuracy in the maps. Finally, the results indicated that Jinjiang city was in a carbon-loss state in 2013 (that is, more carbon was emitted than stored). Carbon sources were distributed mainly in urban and suburban areas, whereas carbon sinks were distributed mainly in suburban areas. The population density, average temperature, and fragmentation of urban functional districts all had a significant effect on the urban carbon surplus. The population density negatively correlated with the carbon surplus. The average temperature and fragmentation of urban functional districts varied across the city. The results may inform policies on such issues as population migration, walkability, environmental management, construction, and urban renewal and thus help decision-makers mitigate carbon loss in cities.","tags":["GIS","Spatial Statistics","RS","Ecological Modeling","Landscape Ecology","Machine Learning","Urban Carbon Cycle","Urban Computing"],"title":"Creating a Carbon Source and Sink Map by Coupling an Ecological Process Model with an Emission Inventory to Study a Carbon Balance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qing Yang","Tianyue Huang","Saige Wang","Jiashuo Li","**Shaoqing Dai**","Sebastian Wright","Yuxuan Wang","Huaiwu Peng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1555459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555459200,"objectID":"8ce92eb469ae772fdbfd39e39bff085b","permalink":"https://gisersqdai.top/mycv/publication/gis-pv-energy/","publishdate":"2019-04-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/mycv/publication/gis-pv-energy/","section":"publication","summary":"The achievement of temperature control target requires a low carbon transition of global energy structure. While China is actively promoting the implementation of large-scale PV generation technology, there is still a lack of scientific knowledge of the generation potential in China. To address this deficiency, this study builds a GIS-based model with 600 land conversion factors incorporated to accurately estimate the large-scale PV power generation potential in China. The results show a potential installed capacity of 1.41 × $10^5$ GW, corresponding to an annual power generation of 1.38874 × $10^{14}$ kWh or 21.4 times national electricity consumption in China 2016. If this potential were fully realized as a replacement for current fossil fuel-based power generation in China 2030, a reduction in China’s carbon intensity of 63–68% compared to 2005 would result, which is sufficient to meet China’s CO$_2$ emission reduction commitment. On a provincial level, while generation potential in Northwest and Inner Mongolia together account for 86% of the total, China's eight economically developed coastal provinces only account for 1%. To achieve a maximum large-scale PV scenario in China 2030, the capacity of inter-regional transmission grids from Northwest region and Inner Mongolia to the regions with insufficient potential should reach an approximate 300 GW. Our study could provide decision-makers with the precise information on large-scale PV power generation map of China, and optimizing low carbon strategies and inter-regional power transmission for achieving sustainable development.","tags":["GIS","RS"],"title":"A GIS-based high spatial resolution assessment of large-scale PV generation potential in China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guoliang Yun","Yuanrong He","Yuantong Jiang","Panfeng Dou","**Shaoqing Dai**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548979200,"objectID":"159c1300c97e310d0f1af871cfc8c057","permalink":"https://gisersqdai.top/mycv/publication/yrt-pm25-drive-factors/","publishdate":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/mycv/publication/yrt-pm25-drive-factors/","section":"publication","summary":"High concentrations of PM2.5 are a primary cause of haze in the lower atmosphere.

We build up a multisource database (forest inventory, digital elevation models, population, and remote sensing imagery) on a uniform coordinate system to support research into the interactions that influence the STUFC. Landsat-5/8 Thermal Mapper images and meteorological data were used to retrieve the temporal and spatial distributions of land surface temperature. Ground observations, which included the forest management planning inventory and population density data, provided the factors that determine the STUFC spatial distribution on an urban scale. The use of a spatial statistical model (GeogDetector model) reveals the interaction mechanisms of STUFC. Although different environmental factors exert different influences on STUFC, in two periods with different hot spots and cold spots, the patch area and dominant tree species proved to be the main factors contributing to STUFC. The interaction between multiple environmental factors increased the STUFC, both linearly and nonlinearly. Strong interactions tended to occur between elevation and dominant species and were prevalent in either hot or cold spots in different years. In conclusion, the combining of multidisciplinary methods (e.g., remote sensing images, ground observations, and spatial statistical models) helps reveal the mechanism of STUFC on an urban scale.","tags":["Spatial Statistics","GIS","RS"],"title":"Determining the Mechanisms that Influence the Surface Temperature of Urban Forest Canopies by Combining Remote Sensing Methods, Ground Observations, and Spatial Statistical Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shudi Zuo","**Shaoqing Dai**","Yaying Li","Jianfeng Tang","Yin Ren"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538611200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538611200,"objectID":"64f9505d12368b3971373b7e31438b5c","permalink":"https://gisersqdai.top/mycv/publication/heavy-metal-geodetector/","publishdate":"2018-10-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/mycv/publication/heavy-metal-geodetector/","section":"publication","summary":"Regional soil quality issues arising from rapid urbanization have received extensive attention. The riverbank that runs through a city is representative of urbanization gradient transformation.

GeoDetector methods not only validated the results of the three other methods, but also provided more possible impact factors. Besides the direct influences, the interaction effects among factors were quantified. Interactive combination with strong nonlinear increment changed from between-two-weak factors in the central region to between-strong-and-weak factors in the suburbs. In the exurbs, the stronger interaction effects were observed between strong and weak factors.

However, due to the limited availability of the sample lands and other space restrictions, the prediction accuracy of current AGB reference maps is associated with deviations, whose source may be related to the poorly understood effects of the spatial heterogeneity of multiple environmental factors (such as topography, soil, and forest structures) on the spatial distribution of AGB. To address these problems, we propose a method that combines machine learning and spatial statistics to determine the influence of biased samples by finding multiple environmental factors of regional covariates through the model algorithm. Subsequently, we consider an empirical case to quantitatively assess the prediction accuracy of the AGB reference map of an Eucalyptus plantation in Nanjing, China. In this case study, the biased AGB analysis data of 90 parse trees are selected and combined with regional forest resource inventory data to build three main machine-learning methods (support vector machine, random forest, and artificial neural network) and a spatial statistical analysis integration technology (a PBSHDE model). The results show that the evaluation indexes of the prediction accuracy (i.e., RMSE, MAE, and MRE) of the method that combines machine learning (random forest) and the PBSHDE model are significantly better than those for machine learning or the PBSHDE model individually. We conclude that the combination of spatial statistical analysis and machine learning can improve the accuracy AGB mapping in regions with biased samples and thus provide accurate predictions from AGB reference maps. Our research methods and conclusions may provide references for AGB remote-sensing mapping and simulation of ecological processes of different types of forests in various countries and tropical regions of the world.","tags":["Machine Learning","Spatial Statistics","GIS","Urban Carbon Cycle"],"title":"Improving the prediction accuracy of forest aboveground biomass benchmark map by integrating machine learning and spatial statistics","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Mapping direct carbon emissions at high-resolution in urban environments could help in the development of measures to mitigate carbon emissions through optimizing the layout of inner structures.\n","date":1527005700,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527005700,"objectID":"fe43f27dba8b0ed18a7033731049b145","permalink":"https://gisersqdai.top/mycv/talk/sa2018talks/","publishdate":"2018-05-22T16:15:00Z","relpermalink":"/mycv/talk/sa2018talks/","section":"talk","summary":"This study gridded the CO$_2$ Emissions at the urban scale and quantified the uncertainties.","tags":["Urban Carbon Cycle","GIS","RS","Spatial Statistics"],"title":"High-Resolution Mapping of Direct CO$_2$ Emissions and Uncertainties at the Urban Scale","type":"talk"},{"authors":["**Shaoqing Dai**","Shudi Zuo","Yin Ren"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1526947200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1526947200,"objectID":"0c3647858c91213bc4f307e577c4020f","permalink":"https://gisersqdai.top/mycv/publication/high-resolution-co2-map-ei-meeting/","publishdate":"2018-05-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/mycv/publication/high-resolution-co2-map-ei-meeting/","section":"publication","summary":"Mapping direct carbon emissions at high-resolution in urban environments could help in the development of measures to mitigate carbon emissions through optimizing the layout of inner structures. It requires the use of a mapping method combining the bottom-up and top-bottom calculations with uncertainty evaluations. This study developed a method for urban scale analyses of carbon emissions, including a theoretical framework of uncertainty distribution and transmission. Using Jinjiang City, China, as a case study, we applied this method to calculate the amount of carbon emissions in grids distributed across a city. This information was used to analyze emission uncertainties and its sources. The calculated emissions were allocated through the accurate spatial identification of three emission sectors and proxy data. Two different population spatialization methods were constructed in order to create 30 m and 500 m resolution grid maps. We designed four different Monte-Carlo simulation scenarios to analyze the uncertainties of the two maps. The results showed that the method developed here was suitable for delineating carbon emissions at the urban-scale. The 30 m resolution map showed that residential emissions were widely distributed, whereas industrial emissions were more concentrated, with the opposite trend being detected in the 500 m resolution map. Calculations of carbon inventory and spatial proxy had more impacts on the 30 m resolution map than on the 500 m resolution map. During the process of spatial superposition, the uncertainties from different sectors showed a nonlinear relationship, which was represented by smaller total uncertainties compared with the sum of uncertainties from the three emission sectors. In conclusion, this study provides important baseline data that could be used to optimize urban form by promoting low-carbon city construction.","tags":["Urban Carbon Cycle","GIS","RS","Spatial Statistics"],"title":"High-resolution mapping of direct CO$_2$ emissions and uncertainties at the urban scale","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guoliang Yun","Shudi Zuo","**Shaoqing Dai**","Xiaodong Song","Chengdong Xu","Yilan Liao","Peiqiang Zhao","Weiyin Chang","Qi Chen","Yaying Li","Jianfeng Tang","Wang Man","Yin Ren"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1522022400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1522022400,"objectID":"96d95ad9a1cec11f22e5f7669b804a1d","permalink":"https://gisersqdai.top/mycv/publication/pm25-geodetector-multi-factors/","publishdate":"2018-03-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/mycv/publication/pm25-geodetector-multi-factors/","section":"publication","summary":"Integration of Landsat images and multisource data using spatial statistical analysis and geographical detector models can reveal the individual and interactive influences of anthropogenic activities and ecological factors on concentrations of atmospheric particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5). This approach has been used in many studies to estimate biomass and forest disturbance patterns and to monitor carbon sinks. However, the approach has rarely been used to comprehensively analyze the individual and interactive influences of anthropogenic factors (e.g., population density, impervious surface percentage) and ecological factors (e.g., canopy density, stand age, and elevation) on PM2.5 concentrations. To do this, we used Landsat-8 images and meteorological data to retrieve quantitative data on the concentrations of particulates (PM2.5), then integrated a forest management planning inventory (FMPI), population density distribution data, meteorological data, and topographic data in a Geographic Information System database, and applied a spatial statistical analysis model to identify aggregated areas (hot spots and cold spots) of particulates in the urban area of Jinjiang city, China. A geographical detector model was used to analyze the individual and interactive influences of anthropogenic and ecological factors on PM2.5 concentrations. We found that particulate concentration hot spots are mainly distributed in urban centers and suburbs, while cold spots are mainly distributed in the suburbs and exurban region. Elevation was the dominant individual factor affecting PM2.5 concentrations, followed by dominant tree species and meteorological factors. A combination of human activities (e.g., population density, impervious surface percentage) and multiple ecological factors caused the dominant interactive effects, resulting in increased PM2.5 concentrations. Our study suggests that human activities and multiple ecological factors effect PM2.5 concentrations both individually and interactively. We conclude that in order to reveal the direct and indirect effects of human activities and multiple factors on PM2.5 concentrations in urban forests, quantification of fusion satellite data and spatial statistical methods should be conducted in urban areas.","tags":["Spatial Statistics","GIS","RS"],"title":"Individual and Interactive Influences of Anthropogenic and Ecological Factors on Forest PM2.5 Concentrations at an Urban Scale","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qin Ye","Gang Zeng","**Shaoqing Dai**","Fenglong Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1518652800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1518652800,"objectID":"28ff13a44bcfbbc9c1dde2b15e902686","permalink":"https://gisersqdai.top/mycv/publication/energy-conservation-and-emissions-reduction-innovation-journal-cn/","publishdate":"2018-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/mycv/publication/energy-conservation-and-emissions-reduction-innovation-journal-cn/","section":"publication","summary":"The impact that environmental regulation has on technology innovation is a hot spot in currently research which already has a large number of empirical studies based on Porter Hypothesis． However there are still controversies in academia about the establishment of weak Porter Hypothesis and narrow Porter Hypothesis． Based on the panel data of application for patent of emission reduction technology of 285 prefectural-level municipalities during 2008 － 2014， comprehensive energy price， and pollutant emission etc． ， we use mixed regression model and systematic GMM method respectively to study the impact that market-oriented policy tool and command-and-control policy tool have on China energy conservation and emission reduction technology innovation． The results show that the environmental regulation hinders the technological innovation at sight however promoting it after lag one issue． So the establishment of weak Porter Hypothesis has time constraints． The lag command-and-control policy tool plays a more positive role in promoting technological innovation than market-oriented policy tool， so narrow Porter Hypothesis couldn’t work． The reason is that the main participants of China energy-saving and emission reduction technology innovation are state-owned enterprises and public institutions．Regionally speaking， the impact which command-and-control policy tool has on technological innovation at sight is non-significant in eastern， central and western regions; market-oriented policy tool has negative effect． And market-oriented policy tool in central region has strongest negative effect， it will diminish in eastern region and become weakest in western region． This is related to regional energy consumption level and the market economic vitality． The research firstly finds that the narrow Porter Hypothesis is not suitable for China emission reduction innovation while the weak Porter Hypothesis works， secondly it provides reference for the formulation of regional energy saving and emission reduction policies.","tags":["GIS","Spatial Statistics"],"title":"Research on the effects of different policy tools on China’s emissions reduction innovation(Chinese)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":" Nov. 16, 2020: Shaoqing Dai passed his PhD qualifier at the Department of Earth Observation Science, Faculty of Geo-information Science and Earth Observation, University of Twente.\n Oct. 27, 2020: We published an invitied paper of special issues \u0026lsquo;Built Environment and Behavior Study\u0026rsquo; in Shanghai Urban Planning Review, namely \u0026lsquo;The Evaluation of Health Effect of Short-term Exposure to PM2.5 during Spring Festival: A Case Study of 25 Cities in the Yangtze River Delta\u0026rsquo;.

However, there are still controversies in academia about the establishment of “weak” and “narrow” versions of PH. Based on the panel data of application for patent of energy conservation and emission reduction (ECER) technology of Chinese city scale during 2008–2014, comprehensive energy price, pollutant emission, etc., mixed regression model and systematic generalized method of moments method were adopted, respectively, to study the impact of market-oriented and command-and-control policy tool on China’s ECER technology innovation. The results show that the environmental regulation hindered the technological innovation in the immediate phase; however, it turned out to be positive in the first-lag phase. Hence, the establishment of “weak” PH is time-bounded. The command-and-control policy tool played a more positive role in promoting technological innovation in the first-lag phase than market-oriented policy tool. Therefore, “narrow” PH is not tenable. The reason is that the main participants of China’s ECER technology innovation are state-owned companies and public institutions. Regionally speaking, the impact which command-and-control policy tool has on technological innovation at sight was non-significant in the eastern, the central, and the western regions of China whilst market-oriented policy tool had a negative effect. And market-oriented policy tool in the central region had strongest negative effect, which would diminish in the eastern region and become weakest in the western region. This was related to regional energy consumption level and the market economic vitality.","tags":["GIS","Spatial Statistics"],"title":"Research on the effects of command-and-control and market-oriented policy tools on China’s energy conservation and emissions reduction innovation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Shaoqing Dai**","Jiajia Li","Sudi Zuo","Yin Ren","Huixian Jiang"],"categories":null,"content":" Introduction The urban underlying surface heavily influences waterlogging. During the urbanization process, vegetation, water, and wetlands are replaced by impervious surfaces, including steel, cement, and other building materials. During the late-1990s, governments began to pay closer attention to the influence of urban underlying surfaces on storm water management. They started to develop low-impact development (LID) practices, which seek to use the landscape to control the water source and reduce the shock loads of storm water. Typical LID practices include green roofs, permeable pavements, and other green infrastructures. With the introduction of the Sponge City concept, China has gradually been introducing LID technology to improve the urban underlying surface and the spatial distribution of landscape.\nMost previous research of LID analyzed simulation experiments and storm water management at the small-scale level, whereas little analysis has been done at the urban level. Moreover, few studies have considered the influence of the natural green infrastructure (NGI), which refers to landscape that is good at receiving water. Here, we analyzed the urban central area of Fuzhou City, China, using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) data to divide the urban underlying surface into NGI and non-NGI landscapes. We extracted the impervious surface from the non-NGI landscape and used the precipitation-volumetric method to simulate waterlogging scenarios. We determined the area of rainwater submersion by simulation experiments, the change in the NGI landscape by overlaying images of the region, and the association between these features by data mining. Using the change in ecology indices, we ascertained the changing spatial patterns of the NGI landscape and used these findings to formulate suggestions for Sponge City planning in Fuzhou. Overall, our work combines three research themes, urban waterlogging, landscape ecology, and data mining, for a deep analysis of the relationship between the NGI landscape and storm runoff in an urban environment.\nMethods Figure 1 Flow chart of the study\nResult  Submerged areas were characterized by high population densities and high levels of human activity.

Numbers of people exposed to the submerged areas of scenarios 1 and 2 were 12,840 and 46,460 people, respectively.\nFigure 2 Visual representation of simulation results for scenario 1 and scenario 2\n Spatial association rule mining revealed a strong association between areas that were converted from NGI landscape and areas that were submerged in our simulations.  Table 2 Results of association rule mining\n   Rules Support Confidence Lift     Submerged=\u0026gt;Change 0.002 0.212 1.655   Stay=\u0026gt;No Submerged 0.865 0.992 1.001    If an area was submerged, then the probability that the area was converted landscape was 21.2%. If an area was not subject to landscape conversion, then the probability that it would not be a submerged area was 99.2%.\nCONCLUSIONS Based on the results of this study, we derived the following conclusions:\n  Simulation analysis for the central urban area of Fuzhou City, assuming a 100-year storm with rainfall durations of 2 and 4 hours, resulted in submerged depths (areas) of 3.943 m (1.345 km2) and 4.055 m (6.032 km2), to which 12,840 and 46,460 people, respectively, were exposed. Submerged areas were found at locations of stronger human activity, which caused a higher risk of waterlogging. The area covered by NGI landscape in the central urban area of Fuzhou City decreased considerably and became more fragmented from 2006 to 2014. Urban residential area covers 40% of the converted landscape. Results of association rule mining showed that the submerged area has an important relationship with the NGI landscape conversion that, in turn, makes waterlogging frequent in urban areas. We used EIC to measure the change in landscape patterns and spatial distribution of the NGI landscape. Based on the results, we identified some ecological nodes and corridors and made some suggestions related to the Sponge City planning of Fuzhou City.

Although there is great potential for reducing emissions in cities, constructing low-carbonemission cities under the carbon-emission reduction target of the 2016 Paris Agreement remains challenging as there is little scientific evidence for use by government decisionmakers. To solve this problem, we must understand the urban carbon-cycle process in greater detail and especially analyze spatiotemporal variations in carbon sources and sinks.\n1 Carbon sink map The forest is the only exact carbon sink. How to map the accurate carbon sink maps? Firstly, we propose herein a low-cost method that combines machine learning and spatial statistics to construct a regional biomass map from non-representative sample units. Secondly, we scaled up an ecological process model to obtain the spatial distribution of regional biomass. Finally, we used some data assimilation technology by these data.\nFigure 1 The accuracy of different methods for biomass estimation\n2 Carbon source map Cities are the main sources of $CO_2$ emissions and, thus, must abate emissions responsibly. About 50% of urban $CO_2$ emissions was attributed to urban forms, mixed land use, building types, and transportation networks. It is necessary to characterize the pixel-based distribution of urban direct $CO_2$ emissions accurately. But large uncertainties was found at the urban scale, it\u0026rsquo;s important to analyze the uncertainties of $CO_2$ emissions gridded map at the urban scale. Besides, exlporing the relationship between $CO_2$ emissions and urban form is useful for planning.\nFigure 2 Comparison between our high resolution $CO_2$ emission gridding map and CHRED\ndetailed informations can see it.\nWe used a general hybrid approach based on global downscaled and bottom-up elements to produce the CO$_2$ emissions gridded maps, identitfied the urban functional districts map, and generated the city-scale effect related impact factors. All the maps were included in a spatial database. Detailed information can see it.\nFigure 3 The high-resolution CO$_2$ girded maps\n3 The relation between CO$_2$ emissions and urban form Understanding the spatial or temporal distribution of carbon cycle including carbon sink and source is the key to design low-carbon city development policy. We compared the relationships between urban form fragmentation and CO$_2$ emissions in an urban system through the analytic framework composed of the Pearson correlation analysis, geographically weighted regression (GWR), and geographical detector methods with the use of multi-source data to construct the CO$_2$ emissions maps. The analytical framework can be applied to CO$_2$ emissions research in urban agglomerations, megacities, and small towns.\nFigure 4 Analytical Framework\nFigure 5 Percentages of CO$_2$ emissions in Jinjiang attributed to total built-up areas and their composite functional land uses\nFigure 6 Geographical detector results for fragmentation factors, PUA, and POID for CO$_2$ emissions from 4 sources.\n","date":1472688000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472688000,"objectID":"9d6c8b4ce37574969d4f40dbc58923ff","permalink":"https://gisersqdai.top/mycv/project/urban-carbon-cycle/","publishdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/mycv/project/urban-carbon-cycle/","section":"project","summary":"We used machine learning, spatial statistics, ecological process model and remote sensing to construct map of urban carbon cycle.","tags":["Urban Carbon Cycle","Landscape Ecology","GIS","RS","Ecological Modeling","Machine Learning","Spatial Statistics"],"title":"Urban Carbon Cycle","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Spatial-temporal data is the key to handling big data in this era.

Table 1 Simulation results of storm water scenarios\n   Simulated parameter Scenario 1 Scenario 2     Storm intensity($L·S^{-1}·ha^{-1}$) 163.183 101.847   Runoff($L·S^{-1}$) 5.342×$10^6$ 6.668×$10^6$   Submerged depth(m) 3.943 4.055   Maximum submerged depth(m) 1.943 2.055   Submerged area ($km^{2}$) 1.345 6.032    The main submerged area in Fuzhou included the central business district. Numbers of people exposed to the submerged areas of scenarios 1 and 2 were 12,840 and 46,460 people, respectively.\nFigure 2 Visual representation of simulation results for scenario 1 and scenario 2\n Spatial association rule mining revealed a strong association between areas that were converted from NGI landscape and areas that were submerged in our simulations.  Table 2 Results of association rule mining\n   Rules Support Confidence Lift     Submerged=\u0026gt;Change 0.002 0.212 1.655   Stay=\u0026gt;No Submerged 0.865 0.992 1.001    If an area was submerged, then the probability that the area was converted landscape was 21.2%. If an area was not subject to landscape conversion, then the probability that it would not be a submerged area was 99.2%.\nOn the other hand, we used multi-source data to identify the urban ecological-production-living spaces and provided some suggesstions for urban resilience simulation optimization. We developed some ArcGIS toolbox based on model builder and Python. Our results won the national third prize in the 2th big data supports spatial plannning and design competition.\n","date":1434067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1434067200,"objectID":"7eaf577fbf2dd2a29ce5160ec775d1bf","permalink":"https://gisersqdai.top/mycv/project/urban-blue-and-green-space/","publishdate":"2015-06-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/mycv/project/urban-blue-and-green-space/","section":"project","summary":"We want to know how the pattern of blue space and green space in urban influence the urban environment.","tags":["GIS","RS","Landscape Ecology","Spatial Statistics","Urban Blue and Green Space","Machine Learning"],"title":"Urban Blue and Green Space","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" There are two projects about the virtual geographical environments and its applications in geography.\n1 The Virtual 3D model of Fuzhou Strait Olympic Sports Center The National Winning Award on 2015 EsriCup National Collegiate Developed Contest in GIS·3D Modeling and Design.\nDemo\nCo-author: Minhang Ye, Ruitong Cheng, Haihan Zhuo\nThe research built up the virtual 3D model of Fuzhou strait olmpic sports center.
