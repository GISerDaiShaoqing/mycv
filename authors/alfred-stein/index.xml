&lt;h3 id=&#34;systematic-review-method&#34;&gt;Systematic review Method&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used the PubMed and Web of Science databases to search for refereed journal articles. To identify articles related to BEA and SVI, we used two sets of search terms: (1) ‘built environment* audit’, ‘auditing’, and ‘virtual audit*’; (2) ‘streetview*’, ‘street view*’, ‘street-view*’, and ‘street view image*’. We collected all the papers published from the inception of the electronic bibliographic databases up to October 2023. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to conduct a systematic review (Moher et al. Citation2009), as depicted in Figure 1. Out of 429 initial results, we identified 96 eligible studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/cms/asset/94087bc3-4359-4dbf-9ff6-9548bb3d9935/tgis_a_2336034_f0001_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1. The flowchart that was followed when selecting and including studies on built environment auditing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;characteristics-of-included-studies&#34;&gt;Characteristics of included studies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All included studies were published after 2010, marking a discernible increase trajectory in the annual number of publications over the past decade, as illustrated in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/cms/asset/b1f0eb76-d6eb-48ee-9120-110ee2dbd814/tgis_a_2336034_f0002_c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2. Number of the included studies published each year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of the studies (89 of 96, 92.7%) utilized Google SVI for BEA, while the remaining seven studies explored alternative SVI sources including Tencent SVI and Baidu SVI. Additionally, 13 studies employed other SVI sources, such as Bing Map, closed-circuit television, daum road view service, Google Earth, and Google Maps alongside Google SVI. In most studies (78 of 96, 81.3%), SVI was processed for BEA manually. Only 18 studies used computer vision and artificial intelligence technologies. Among these, deep learning techniques were particularly prevalent, employing convolutional neural network models like visual geometry group-16, visual geometry group-19, ResNet-18, SegNet, and DeepLab V3+. These models were specifically tailored for image segmentation tasks, offering fine-scale detection of eye-level objects, such as trees, sidewalks, and bike lanes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEA tools are defined as a range of developed toolsets or instruments utilized to audit and assess built environment attributes, including physical structures, facilities, and surroundings within a given study area, comprising both validated and unvalidated auditing tools. The validated auditing tools were defined as a series of commonly used auditing tools, which are based on well-established references and often implemented as platforms, toolsets, and frameworks. In contrast, unvalidated auditing tools are usually self-developed, lacking validation in other studies, and thus could only serve as conceptual methods without systematic implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/cms/asset/b95b20c6-0fd4-490f-9b14-f4b7dab19fe3/tgis_a_2336034_f0003_c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3. An overview of the studies using different built environment auditing tools in different countries, (a) represents the number of these tools within different countries (in parentheses), (b) represents the number of these tools that have been applied by different groups and in various studies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/cms/asset/543541e4-3bfc-4421-8302-abdb78417836/tgis_a_2336034_f0004_c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4. The number of the included studies using different built environment auditing tools at different scales (in parentheses). Note: N—National; S—State (e.g. in the US) or equivalent unit; C—City; Cn—multicity; County—County or equivalent unit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequently audited built environment attributes included street-related features (e.g. street lights, street parking, and streetscape aesthetics) (n = 52), sidewalk-related features (e.g. width, buffers, and continuity) (n = 49), and traffic-related features (e.g. signals, volume, public transit stops, and environment) (n = 47). Other notable attributes include land use (n = 33), facility-related features (n = 28), visual perceptions (e.g. aesthetics) (n = 25), and social environment (e.g. safety) (n = 16).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/cms/asset/21f6ad73-3737-4327-8ea9-9d430ee9a217/tgis_a_2336034_f0005_c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 5. The count of studies auditing different built environment attributes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most studies (n = 64), undertook an evaluation of the reliability associated with the assessed built environment attributes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choice of indicators for audited built environment attributes differs among studies. Due to the ambiguity in some auditing characteristic definitions, the reliability and validity of gathered audit measures tend to be higher for objective attributes than subjective assessments. Among audited attributes, the presence of a sidewalk, a typical objective attribute, has the highest average reliability (0.837) across the majority of studies, exceeding the noteworthy threshold of 0.7 (as illustrated in Figure 6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/cms/asset/bcb746f4-5213-4633-a1d3-fd3cb4d72768/tgis_a_2336034_f0006_c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhancing accuracy in quantifying built environment features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choosing a suitable SVI-based BEA method and enhancing robustness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Addressing time lag and spatial limitations of SVI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bridging the BEA and urban exposome observation through SVI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a systematic review of the commonly audited built environment attributes and auditing tools, our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the state-of-the-art SVI-based auditing approaches and offer insights into future directions for development. The reliability of these audits varies depending on the type of attribute and the assessment tool used. We have learned that objective attributes, such as the presence of a sidewalk, generally yield higher reliability, while subjective assessments may be influenced by auditor biases, resulting in lower reliability. The use of standardized auditing tools, such as S-VAT, across multiple cities demonstrates the potential for improved comparability and generalizability of research findings. Considering the number of research groups that used these tools, ANC and MAPS were identified as the two most widely accepted auditing tools. Furthermore, many standardized auditing tools have been exclusively implemented in specific countries. This is often attributed to auditing of those attributes that are relevant in these particular countries, which may not necessarily align with conditions found in other nations. Consequently, this localization of attributes has resulted in higher reliability when the tools are applied in the country where they were originally developed, as compared to their performance in other countries. The varying levels of reliability for different attributes within the same tool indicate the need for further refinement and standardization of assessment criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methodology’s merits lie in the adoption of a classification of auditing aims and the integration of various built environment features, ultimately allowing researchers to better understand the relationship between urban design and public health. The broader impact of these findings can inform urban planning and policy-making efforts to promote healthier and more sustainable living environments. Achieving higher reliability in built environment audits requires a careful balance between objective and subjective attributes and the adoption of standardized tools and assessment criteria. This can lead to more robust research findings and an improved understanding of urban environments, ultimately contributing to better-informed urban planning and policy decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;proposed-bikeability-framework&#34;&gt;Proposed bikeability framework&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We construct the bikeability evaluation framework by combining the collected multi-source spatio-temporal big data (Figure 1 and Figure 2). The proposed bikeability evaluation framework contains four subindexes, i.e., safety, comfort, accessibility, and vitality, and thirteen influencing indicators, i.e., wind speed, road slope, precipitation, temperature, sky view index, green view index, trajectory sinuosity, air pollution, average speed of trajectory, public transportation accessibility, commercial accessibility, number of trajectory and crowdedness. All indicators used in our framework belong to objective and quantitative measurements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1569843223003631-gr2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1. The proposed bikeability framework.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1569843223003631-gr3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2. Street view imagery semantic segmentation process, revised from Chen et al. (2018).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;spatiotemporal-analysis-of-bikeability&#34;&gt;Spatiotemporal analysis of bikeability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first present and discuss the results of four subindexes across Xiamen Island on a daily basis from December 21 to 25th, 2020 (Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1569843223003631-gr4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3. The figures show the daily safety, comfort, accessibility, and vitality of Xiamen Island from top row to bottom row, where from left column to right column respectively represent the dates from 21 to 25th.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The calculation of the bikeability index requires assigning appropriate weights to each indicators. To determine these weights, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) on the 13 indicators. The PCA resulted in 6 components, providing a balance between a minimal number of components and reliable explained variance. The relationships between components and indicators are displayed in Figure 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1569843223003631-gr5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4. The PCA result for 13 indicators indicates correspondence between principal components and original indicators.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temporal distribution of the bikeability index shows a fluctuation throughout the study period, as seen in Figure 5.The temporal distribution of the bikeability index shows a fluctuation throughout the study period, as seen in Fig. 8. On the 21st and 22nd, the average values were recorded as 0.236 and 0.233, respectively. On the 23rd, however, there was a noticeable drop in the bikeability index value, reaching a low of 0.098. Despite this decrease, the values rebounded to 0.188 and 0.185 on the 24th and 25th, respectively. This fluctuation in the bikeability index is mainly due to a rainfall event that occurred in Xiamen on the 23rd. The rainy conditions led to a significant decrease in the safety subindex, which in turn decreased the overall value of the bikeability index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1569843223003631-gr7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 5. Average bikeability of Xiamen Island on December 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th, 2020, the roads highlighted in red indicate lower levels of bikeability, whereas those in green indicate higher levels of bikeability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hourly pattern of the bikeability index reveals a different trend compared to the daily change (Fig. 8). As seen in Fig. 8, the hourly bikeability index values exhibit much less fluctuation. The value was recorded as 0.184 at 6:00 a.m. and then gradually increased, reaching its peak at 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. with values of 0.198 and 0.195, respectively. This increase was mainly due to an increase in the vitality subindex, as more people were using shared bicycles between 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. on working days. However, at 9:00 a.m., the value dropped to its lowest point at 0.17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1569843223003631-gr8.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 6. Average bikeability of Xiamen Island at 6:00, 7:00, 8:00, and 9:00 a.m., the roads highlighted in red indicate lower levels of bikeability, whereas those in green indicate higher levels of bikeability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further validate our proposed index, we conducted a case study analysis in the central area of Xiamen CR, which is the middle continuous hotspot area. The location of this case study is the shared bicycle cycling hotspot at the intersection of Hubin Nanlu and Hubin Donglu, near the commercial center of Xiamen Wanxiangcheng, between 8:00–9:00 a.m. on December 21, 2020, as shown in Figure 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1569843223003631-gr10.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 7. Case study field validation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study area is centered around the Huarun commercial center, surrounded by a large residential area. During the morning hours, a substantial amount of shared bicycles are used in this region, contributing to a relatively high bikeability index. This highlights the significance of cycling routes in determining the level of bikeability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current cycling infrastructure falls short of supporting high-friendly cycling routes. For example, the road section near Hubin Middle School, which is located in a residential area and has a high demand for commuting, features a high density of shared bicycle stops, catering, shopping, and life services. The natural environment also favors cycling with low slopes, moderate wind speed, low precipitation, suitable temperature, overcast weather, and good air quality. Despite these favorable conditions, this section is congested during the morning rush hour due to a narrow non-motorized lane, slow average speed, and high volume of people commuting and going to school, resulting in low bikeability in this section despite high cycling activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the demand for shared bicycles in hot spot regions is much higher, underscoring the importance of ensuring the availability of bicycles and easy accessibility. As shown in the figure, most road sections in the hot spot area have high densities of parking spots. However, there is a shortage of parking spots on the east side of Huarun Center, leading to a concentration of cyclists in other areas, causing congestion and potentially affecting commuting efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case study showcases how our bikeability index takes into account the purpose of cycling and reflects cyclists’ preferred routes. Nonetheless, there remain disparities between the actual infrastructure, preferred routes, and regional conditions. By integrating the index system with real-time data, it is possible to provide suggestions for enhancing regional cycling conditions. The findings of this research can guide management departments and shared bicycle providers to improve facilities and offer optimal route planning for cyclists to avoid congestion and overcome difficulties in finding available bicycles. In conclusion, the bikeability index can provide comprehensive decision-making recommendations and advance the development of cycling-friendly cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;implications-for-policy-and-practice&#34;&gt;Implications for policy and practice&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The variability in the bikeability index across different segments presents an opportunity for transportation planners to enhance cycling infrastructure. Monitoring the spatiotemporal dynamics of bikeability can help identify potential environmental or infrastructure changes and their impact on the community’s level of bikeability. To ensure the relevance of the cycling friendliness index, case studies that incorporate additional infrastructure data are necessary for local comparison of bikeability results, enabling the proposal of landable solutions for varying infrastructure. For instance, the fusion analysis of parking spot electronic fence data and bikeability could expose discrepancies between regional cycling infrastructure and cyclists’ preferences, providing actionable recommendations to government departments and guiding users to cycle in a more bike-friendly manner.&lt;/p&gt;
