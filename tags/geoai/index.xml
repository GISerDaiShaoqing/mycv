&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-collection&#34;&gt;Data Collection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workflow of mass-downloading SVIs started with generating the sampling points with an interval of 10 m along the OpenStreetMap (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.openstreetmap.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://www.openstreetmap.org&lt;/a&gt;) road networks (Figure 1a). Second, we determined the heading direction and pitch, two parameters in image customisation (Figure 1b and c). Heading direction defines the compass heading of the camera with the value from 0° to 360°. Four heading directions (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) were selected for a full surrounding view. The pitch represents the up/down angle at which the street view is taken. Compared to other studies that adopt pitch 0° for eye-level only, our strategy incorporates two pitches (0° and 90°) to collect both eye-level images reflecting horizontal streetscape and sky-view images reflecting the vertical sky openness (Figure 1d and e). Finally, we determined the acquisition time: 2019 or 2020. Our objective is to improve the quantity of SVIs by employing a compact sampling point density and a comparatively inclusive acquisition timeframe. Preliminary assessments indicated that not all sampling points have images, and annual updates are not guaranteed. Ideally, if images are available, eight images are collected per year per sampling point. Each image has 1024 ∗ 512 pixels. In total, we generated 83,925 sampling points and downloaded 737,704 images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in Figure 2, this study is conducted within the HPM framework, which consists of three steps. We first generate physical, locational variables, extract 3D variables from SVIs, and then construct HPM in different valuation models, namely OLS, GWR and RF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$V=f(P,L,E_{3d})$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RF performs the best among all three models. $R^2$ increases from 0.716 to 0.768 by adding 3D variables. In addition to R2 values, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE are also used to evaluate the model accuracy, as shown in Table 3. The lowest RMSE in RF is 1669.60 $yuan/m^2$. Taking the average property value (14,318 $yuan/m^2$), the MAPE of estimation in RF is 11.66%. In summary, OLS has the basic performance, GWR has improvement, and RF has the best explainability and the least errors in different regards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 4 gives an overview of 3Dss in GWR. The distribution of 3Dss has a trend of expansion from the centre towards the periphery (Figure 4c and d). The city centre of Xi&amp;rsquo;an has narrow street width and densely distributed buildings. The north and west peripheries have improved urban design with broader roads and more sky exposure. The distribution of its coefficients has a similar tendency (Figure 4a). In the centre, 3Dss has negative values. The fact shows that the presence of sky is not favoured for higher property values. The negativity reduces and eventually becomes positive as it gets farther from the centre. Figure 4b shows the distribution of the p value of 3Dss, indicating the geographical coverage when 3Dss is statistical significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0197397525000049-gr5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 5 displays the relative importance of all the variables. Among the 3D variables, road, tree and grass from eye-level images are the top three influential variables with values of 1, 0.619 and 0.541. Sky from sky-view images ranks fourth (0.432) in the total and first in sky-view variables. Building from sky-view images closely follows with a value of 0.411. The sequence of other 3D variables is as follows: building (0.369), sky (0.361), sidewalk (0.327) in eye-level images, separately. Tree in sky-view images, has the least value (0.26) among 3D variables, but it is still ahead of several physical and locational variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 5. The relative importance of variables in Random Forest (RF) model.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 6 illustrates the PDPs of all 3D variables. 3Det, 3Deg, 3Der, 3Dss, and 3Dsb share a similar pattern. In the early stage, there is hardly an impact on property values; then, the influence becomes obvious after a certain value. After reaching another value, the impact again becomes insignificant. Certain values vary among different variables. In eye-level images, tree starts at 0.10 and ends at 0.15; grass starts at 0.08 and ends at 0.22, road starts at 0.23 and ends at 0.26. In sky-view images, sky starts at 0.30 and ends at 0.65, building starts at 0.06 and ends at 0.12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the spatial changes happening in the vertical direction in cities because of the construction of high-rise buildings, it is necessary to conceptually and technically identify the hedonic value of 3D and add 3D variables in HPM for property valuation. Our empirical results show: 1) 3D variables have made significant contributions to HPM, and the sky-view angle cannot be overlooked. 2) In the sky-view angle, sky is positively correlated while the presence of buildings and trees are negatively correlated with property values. The influence direction of building and tree are different in eye-level and sky-view images, which further reminds the importance of sky-view angle. 3) RF outperforms OLS and GWR regarding a higher model fitting and stronger explainability power to interpret the influences of 3D variables. The study confirms the important role of 3D in HPM in the context of vertically developed cities with generous amounts of high-rise buildings. Our findings are expected to provide consultancy value for housing policy-making, such as fair property taxation and equal land use policy. In conclusion, this study provides solid evidences that SVIs and AI can quantify the 3D built environment at a low cost on a mass scale (technically feasible), and the sky-view angle is meaningful in valuation practices in vertical cities (practically significant), laying a foundation for future 3D property valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Street view imagery-based built environment auditing tools: a systematic review</title>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;systematic-review-method&#34;&gt;Systematic review Method&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used the PubMed and Web of Science databases to search for refereed journal articles. To identify articles related to BEA and SVI, we used two sets of search terms: (1) ‘built environment* audit’, ‘auditing’, and ‘virtual audit*’; (2) ‘streetview*’, ‘street view*’, ‘street-view*’, and ‘street view image*’. We collected all the papers published from the inception of the electronic bibliographic databases up to October 2023. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to conduct a systematic review (Moher et al. Citation2009), as depicted in Figure 1. Out of 429 initial results, we identified 96 eligible studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/cms/asset/94087bc3-4359-4dbf-9ff6-9548bb3d9935/tgis_a_2336034_f0001_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1. The flowchart that was followed when selecting and including studies on built environment auditing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;characteristics-of-included-studies&#34;&gt;Characteristics of included studies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All included studies were published after 2010, marking a discernible increase trajectory in the annual number of publications over the past decade, as illustrated in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/cms/asset/b1f0eb76-d6eb-48ee-9120-110ee2dbd814/tgis_a_2336034_f0002_c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2. Number of the included studies published each year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of the studies (89 of 96, 92.7%) utilized Google SVI for BEA, while the remaining seven studies explored alternative SVI sources including Tencent SVI and Baidu SVI. Additionally, 13 studies employed other SVI sources, such as Bing Map, closed-circuit television, daum road view service, Google Earth, and Google Maps alongside Google SVI. In most studies (78 of 96, 81.3%), SVI was processed for BEA manually. Only 18 studies used computer vision and artificial intelligence technologies. Among these, deep learning techniques were particularly prevalent, employing convolutional neural network models like visual geometry group-16, visual geometry group-19, ResNet-18, SegNet, and DeepLab V3+. These models were specifically tailored for image segmentation tasks, offering fine-scale detection of eye-level objects, such as trees, sidewalks, and bike lanes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEA tools are defined as a range of developed toolsets or instruments utilized to audit and assess built environment attributes, including physical structures, facilities, and surroundings within a given study area, comprising both validated and unvalidated auditing tools. The validated auditing tools were defined as a series of commonly used auditing tools, which are based on well-established references and often implemented as platforms, toolsets, and frameworks. In contrast, unvalidated auditing tools are usually self-developed, lacking validation in other studies, and thus could only serve as conceptual methods without systematic implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/cms/asset/b95b20c6-0fd4-490f-9b14-f4b7dab19fe3/tgis_a_2336034_f0003_c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3. An overview of the studies using different built environment auditing tools in different countries, (a) represents the number of these tools within different countries (in parentheses), (b) represents the number of these tools that have been applied by different groups and in various studies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/cms/asset/543541e4-3bfc-4421-8302-abdb78417836/tgis_a_2336034_f0004_c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequently audited built environment attributes included street-related features (e.g. street lights, street parking, and streetscape aesthetics) (n = 52), sidewalk-related features (e.g. width, buffers, and continuity) (n = 49), and traffic-related features (e.g. signals, volume, public transit stops, and environment) (n = 47). Other notable attributes include land use (n = 33), facility-related features (n = 28), visual perceptions (e.g. aesthetics) (n = 25), and social environment (e.g. safety) (n = 16).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/cms/asset/21f6ad73-3737-4327-8ea9-9d430ee9a217/tgis_a_2336034_f0005_c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 5. The count of studies auditing different built environment attributes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most studies (n = 64), undertook an evaluation of the reliability associated with the assessed built environment attributes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choice of indicators for audited built environment attributes differs among studies. Due to the ambiguity in some auditing characteristic definitions, the reliability and validity of gathered audit measures tend to be higher for objective attributes than subjective assessments. Among audited attributes, the presence of a sidewalk, a typical objective attribute, has the highest average reliability (0.837) across the majority of studies, exceeding the noteworthy threshold of 0.7 (as illustrated in Figure 6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/cms/asset/bcb746f4-5213-4633-a1d3-fd3cb4d72768/tgis_a_2336034_f0006_c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Enhancing accuracy in quantifying built environment features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choosing a suitable SVI-based BEA method and enhancing robustness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Addressing time lag and spatial limitations of SVI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bridging the BEA and urban exposome observation through SVI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a systematic review of the commonly audited built environment attributes and auditing tools, our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the state-of-the-art SVI-based auditing approaches and offer insights into future directions for development. The reliability of these audits varies depending on the type of attribute and the assessment tool used. We have learned that objective attributes, such as the presence of a sidewalk, generally yield higher reliability, while subjective assessments may be influenced by auditor biases, resulting in lower reliability. The use of standardized auditing tools, such as S-VAT, across multiple cities demonstrates the potential for improved comparability and generalizability of research findings. Considering the number of research groups that used these tools, ANC and MAPS were identified as the two most widely accepted auditing tools. Furthermore, many standardized auditing tools have been exclusively implemented in specific countries. This is often attributed to auditing of those attributes that are relevant in these particular countries, which may not necessarily align with conditions found in other nations. Consequently, this localization of attributes has resulted in higher reliability when the tools are applied in the country where they were originally developed, as compared to their performance in other countries. The varying levels of reliability for different attributes within the same tool indicate the need for further refinement and standardization of assessment criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methodology’s merits lie in the adoption of a classification of auditing aims and the integration of various built environment features, ultimately allowing researchers to better understand the relationship between urban design and public health. The broader impact of these findings can inform urban planning and policy-making efforts to promote healthier and more sustainable living environments. Achieving higher reliability in built environment audits requires a careful balance between objective and subjective attributes and the adoption of standardized tools and assessment criteria. This can lead to more robust research findings and an improved understanding of urban environments, ultimately contributing to better-informed urban planning and policy decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;proposed-bikeability-framework&#34;&gt;Proposed bikeability framework&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We construct the bikeability evaluation framework by combining the collected multi-source spatio-temporal big data (Figure 1 and Figure 2). The proposed bikeability evaluation framework contains four subindexes, i.e., safety, comfort, accessibility, and vitality, and thirteen influencing indicators, i.e., wind speed, road slope, precipitation, temperature, sky view index, green view index, trajectory sinuosity, air pollution, average speed of trajectory, public transportation accessibility, commercial accessibility, number of trajectory and crowdedness. All indicators used in our framework belong to objective and quantitative measurements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;spatiotemporal-analysis-of-bikeability&#34;&gt;Spatiotemporal analysis of bikeability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first present and discuss the results of four subindexes across Xiamen Island on a daily basis from December 21 to 25th, 2020 (Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1569843223003631-gr4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3. The figures show the daily safety, comfort, accessibility, and vitality of Xiamen Island from top row to bottom row, where from left column to right column respectively represent the dates from 21 to 25th.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The calculation of the bikeability index requires assigning appropriate weights to each indicators. To determine these weights, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) on the 13 indicators. The PCA resulted in 6 components, providing a balance between a minimal number of components and reliable explained variance. The relationships between components and indicators are displayed in Figure 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1569843223003631-gr5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4. The PCA result for 13 indicators indicates correspondence between principal components and original indicators.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temporal distribution of the bikeability index shows a fluctuation throughout the study period, as seen in Figure 5.The temporal distribution of the bikeability index shows a fluctuation throughout the study period, as seen in Fig. 8. On the 21st and 22nd, the average values were recorded as 0.236 and 0.233, respectively. On the 23rd, however, there was a noticeable drop in the bikeability index value, reaching a low of 0.098. Despite this decrease, the values rebounded to 0.188 and 0.185 on the 24th and 25th, respectively. This fluctuation in the bikeability index is mainly due to a rainfall event that occurred in Xiamen on the 23rd. The rainy conditions led to a significant decrease in the safety subindex, which in turn decreased the overall value of the bikeability index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1569843223003631-gr7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 5. Average bikeability of Xiamen Island on December 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th, 2020, the roads highlighted in red indicate lower levels of bikeability, whereas those in green indicate higher levels of bikeability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hourly pattern of the bikeability index reveals a different trend compared to the daily change (Fig. 8). As seen in Fig. 8, the hourly bikeability index values exhibit much less fluctuation. The value was recorded as 0.184 at 6:00 a.m. and then gradually increased, reaching its peak at 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. with values of 0.198 and 0.195, respectively. This increase was mainly due to an increase in the vitality subindex, as more people were using shared bicycles between 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. on working days. However, at 9:00 a.m., the value dropped to its lowest point at 0.17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1569843223003631-gr8.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 6. Average bikeability of Xiamen Island at 6:00, 7:00, 8:00, and 9:00 a.m., the roads highlighted in red indicate lower levels of bikeability, whereas those in green indicate higher levels of bikeability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further validate our proposed index, we conducted a case study analysis in the central area of Xiamen CR, which is the middle continuous hotspot area. The location of this case study is the shared bicycle cycling hotspot at the intersection of Hubin Nanlu and Hubin Donglu, near the commercial center of Xiamen Wanxiangcheng, between 8:00–9:00 a.m. on December 21, 2020, as shown in Figure 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1569843223003631-gr10.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 7. Case study field validation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study area is centered around the Huarun commercial center, surrounded by a large residential area. During the morning hours, a substantial amount of shared bicycles are used in this region, contributing to a relatively high bikeability index. This highlights the significance of cycling routes in determining the level of bikeability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current cycling infrastructure falls short of supporting high-friendly cycling routes. For example, the road section near Hubin Middle School, which is located in a residential area and has a high demand for commuting, features a high density of shared bicycle stops, catering, shopping, and life services. The natural environment also favors cycling with low slopes, moderate wind speed, low precipitation, suitable temperature, overcast weather, and good air quality. Despite these favorable conditions, this section is congested during the morning rush hour due to a narrow non-motorized lane, slow average speed, and high volume of people commuting and going to school, resulting in low bikeability in this section despite high cycling activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the demand for shared bicycles in hot spot regions is much higher, underscoring the importance of ensuring the availability of bicycles and easy accessibility. As shown in the figure, most road sections in the hot spot area have high densities of parking spots. However, there is a shortage of parking spots on the east side of Huarun Center, leading to a concentration of cyclists in other areas, causing congestion and potentially affecting commuting efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case study showcases how our bikeability index takes into account the purpose of cycling and reflects cyclists’ preferred routes. Nonetheless, there remain disparities between the actual infrastructure, preferred routes, and regional conditions. By integrating the index system with real-time data, it is possible to provide suggestions for enhancing regional cycling conditions. The findings of this research can guide management departments and shared bicycle providers to improve facilities and offer optimal route planning for cyclists to avoid congestion and overcome difficulties in finding available bicycles. In conclusion, the bikeability index can provide comprehensive decision-making recommendations and advance the development of cycling-friendly cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;implications-for-policy-and-practice&#34;&gt;Implications for policy and practice&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The variability in the bikeability index across different segments presents an opportunity for transportation planners to enhance cycling infrastructure. Monitoring the spatiotemporal dynamics of bikeability can help identify potential environmental or infrastructure changes and their impact on the community’s level of bikeability. To ensure the relevance of the cycling friendliness index, case studies that incorporate additional infrastructure data are necessary for local comparison of bikeability results, enabling the proposal of landable solutions for varying infrastructure. For instance, the fusion analysis of parking spot electronic fence data and bikeability could expose discrepancies between regional cycling infrastructure and cyclists’ preferences, providing actionable recommendations to government departments and guiding users to cycle in a more bike-friendly manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1 Framework for estimating (a–c) the machine learning models, (d) the P-BSHADE model, and the three models that combine machine learning with the P-BSHADE model ((a,d), (b,d) and (c,d)).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.mdpi.com/forests/forests-12-01663/article_deploy/html/images/forests-12-01663-g004-550.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2 Prediction performance of the seven different models. (a) MAE and (b) MRE are presented as boxplots for each prediction method, with the median (black horizontal line in the box), interquartile range (25–75% in the box), range 5–95% (whiskers), and outliers (asterisks) labeled (S1 = SVM, S2 = RBF-ANN, S3 = RF, S4 = P-BSHADE, S5 = SVM &amp;amp; P-BSHADE, S6 = RBF-ANN &amp;amp; P-BSHADE, S7 = RF &amp;amp; P-BSHADE, S8 = allometric model, Allome = allometric model, ML = machine learning, and Sp Stats = spatial statistics). Histogram distributions of RMSE and nRMSE for each prediction method are presented in panels &amp;copy; and (d), respectively.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.mdpi.com/forests/forests-12-01663/article_deploy/html/images/forests-12-01663-g005-550.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3 Improved accuracy assessment indexes of three combined machine learning and spatial statistical methods are revealed by comparison with three corresponding machine learning methods. Panels (a–d) show the MAE, MRE, RMSE, and nRMSE, respectively; S1 vs. S5 compares S5 with S1, S2 vs. S6 compares S6 with S2, and S3 vs. S7 compares S7 with S3 (S1 = SVM, S2 = RBF-ANN, S3 = RF, S5 = SVM &amp;amp; P-BSHADE, S6 = RBF-ANN &amp;amp; P-BSHADE, S7 = RF &amp;amp; P-BSHADE)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forest AGB estimates at the plot level play a major role in connecting accurate single-tree AGB measurements to relatively difficult regional AGB estimates. However, AGB estimates at the plot level are plagued by numerous uncertainties. Improving the plot-level model of forest AGB is a key issue in producing accurate AGB maps. A variety of prediction models have been applied to make accurate AGB estimates, all of which have their own advantages and disadvantages. Different approaches complement the advantages of different models and may yield more accurate AGB estimates than would otherwise be produced by using a single method. The main goal of the current study was to determine whether combining machine learning with spatial statistics can improve plot-level AGB estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study explores the prediction performance of different AGB models, and the results show that the model combining the random forest and P-BSHADE models substantially improves the accuracy of the estimates of forest AGB. The results of this study suggest that combining machine learning with spatial statistics improves plot-level AGB estimates. The understanding gained here should help to improve AGB mapping in other regions and in different types of forests.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Approaches to Anticipate the Risk of Reverse Zoonosis</title>
      <link>https://gisersqdai.top/mycv/publication/tree-covid-19-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

&lt;h4 id=&#34;human-activities-exacerbate-the-risks-from-zoonotic-diseases&#34;&gt;Human Activities Exacerbate the Risks from Zoonotic Diseases&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 has been the most widespread zoonotic pandemic to affect humanity in over a century, reflecting the problem of human activities exacerbating the risks of pathogen spillover, such as hunting, butchering, farming, deforestation, reforestation, irrigation, and traveling. Moreover, it has caused ecological feedbacks at local scales (e.g., bi-directional transmission of COVID-19 between animals and humans, which could augment the COVID-19 risk in both animals and humans).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;reverse-zoonosis-of-covid-19&#34;&gt;Reverse Zoonosis of COVID-19&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infection of animals with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from humans has highlighted the importance of understanding ‘reverse zoonosis’ (zooanthroponosis). Compared with three of the four possible routes of transmission for zoonotic diseases (i.e., animal–human, animal–animal, human–human), which have been well studied and confirmed, human–animal transmission lacks sufficient research due to the rare occurrence prior to COVID-19. Once such reverse zoonosis occurs it may cause the further evolution of viruses and affect the effectiveness of potential COVID-19 vaccines. Given the growing populations of livestock and other domesticated animals, increasing proximity between animals and humans in multiple settings (e.g., wet markets, home, and animal production facilities), and the relatively fewer resources assigned for animal testing during human outbreaks with zoonotic potential (particularly asymptomatic infections), new animals diseases may spread undetected. Proactive consideration of such reverse zoonosis enables the creation of management strategies. Therefore, reverse zoonoses require more rigorous and widespread macroecological and microbial studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;featured.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Natural Infections of Pet, Zoo, and Livestock Animals as of 11 March 2021 Mapped onto Number of Confirmed Cases in the Human Population.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;building-resilience-against-future-reverse-zoonoses&#34;&gt;Building Resilience against Future Reverse Zoonoses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reverse zoonoses may cause reduction and even extinction of the wild animal populations susceptible to viruses, which could destroy local biodiversity and ecological balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preventing reverse zoonoses also requires understanding pathogen feedback loops at the wildlife–livestock/pet–human interface. This will require greater capacities and commitments for pathogen discovery, mutation rate detection, and surveillance, in order to improve the prediction of pandemic potential, leading to management actions that interrupt possible pathways of spillover and transmission. Understanding these key evolutionary processes and ecological interactions calls for integrated virus–animal–human–environment surveillance systems. Spatial lifecourse epidemiology also provides a uniform analytical framework to link ecological surveillance to the national disease reporting system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A proposed workflow to analyze the uncertainties caused by gridded model and model input.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fine-resolution (30 m) maps have a larger spatial variation in CO$_2$ emissions, which gives the fine-resolution maps a higher degree of uncertainty propagation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This indicates a nonlinear change between the sum of the uncertainties for different sectors and the actual uncertainties in the gridded maps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The nonlinear change can be explained by the “compensation of error” phenomenon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimating $CO_2$ emissions at the urban scale, including both un-gridded (i.e., administrative unit maps) and gridded maps, cannot avoid the propagation of uncertainties from input to result, which highlights the importance of being aware of uncertainty estimation, especially in gridded maps due to its implications for the precision mitigation of $CO_2$ emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address the above mentioned issue, an analytic workflow was proposed to analyze the propagated uncertainties caused by the gridded model and the input for gridded $CO_2$ emission maps. The present workflow used four sub-modules based on Monte Carlo simulations and a bootstrap sampling method to analyze uncertainties, without other detailed open emission inventories. Two of the submodules obtained the corresponding uncertainty of each grid value, generated the uncertainty map caused by the gridded model, and the uncertainties for the sum of each cell (also referred to as propagated uncertainties caused by the model); the other submodules generated the uncertainty distribution maps based on the total emission estimations and spatial proxies (also referred to as propagated uncertainties caused by input).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.mdpi.com/remotesensing/remotesensing-12-03932/article_deploy/html/images/remotesensing-12-03932-g001-550.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1 Analytic workflow of the uncertainty propagation in gridded $CO_2$ emission maps. ALs, activity levels; CI, confidence interval; EFs, emission factors; GDP, gross domestic product; KS, Kolmogorov–Smirnov; LUT, look up table; MLE, maximum likelihood estimation; NTL, night time light; PDFs, probability distribution functions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We regarded the gridded maps of $CO_2$ emissions constructed in previous studies as a case study, and applied the workflow to estimate the uncertainties. The estimation of different uncertainties helps decision makers in formulating relevant policies. Uncertainties in total emission estimations aid the determination of emission reduction targets, the corresponding risks for cities and enterprises, and significant emission sources. Uncertainty maps could help to identify locations suitable for developing low-carbon communities. Fine-resolution (30 m) maps have a larger spatial variation in $CO_2$ emissions, which gives the fine-resolution maps a higher degree of uncertainty propagation. Furthermore, the uncertainties of gridded $CO_2$ emission maps, caused by inserting a random error into spatial proxies, were found to decrease after the gridding process. This can be explained by the “compensation of error” phenomenon, which may be attributed to the cancellation of the overestimated and underestimated values among the different sectors at the same grid. This indicates a nonlinear change between the sum of the uncertainties for different sectors and the actual uncertainties in the gridded maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should not ignore the health risks of short-term exposure to PM 2.5 caused by human mobility behavior during the Spring Festival, because the estimated average increased risks are from 0.25 to 0.39. The highest risk is more than 0.9. This reveals strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the health effect of short-term exposure to PM 2.5. Even the value of risks could change from 0.84 to-0.75 in two days. Most of the travel populations in the Yangtze River Delta have increased the health risk of short-term exposure to PM 2.5 caused by human mobility during the Spring Festival, such as Shanghai and Suzhou, with the exposed populations reaching to nearly 13.2 million and 6 million.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Spatial Lifecourse Health was proposed by my supervisor, Dr.Jia Peng in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(18)30245-6/fulltext&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lancet Planetary Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Now it is also applied to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471492220300052&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;infectious disease&lt;/a&gt;, especially the COVID-19 pandemic. It&amp;rsquo;s an emerging research field. There are &lt;a href=&#34;https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/EHP4868&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the top 10 research priorities in Spatial Lifecourse Epidemiology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829219306355&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the Spatial Lifecourse Epidemiology Reporting Standards (ISLE-ReSt) statement&lt;/a&gt; publishing in the Journals. My Ph.D. project will focus on how to use the Earth Observation handling(Google Earth Engine), geospatial big data handling(Street View Image segment), and spatial statistics model to explore the health geography and spatial epidemiology problem. Our research interests include obesity, infectious disease like COVID-19, non-communicate disease, but not limited to these topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;1-obesity&#34;&gt;1 Obesity&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We conducted a series of systematic reviews articles in &lt;em&gt;Obesity Reviews&lt;/em&gt; to determine all the obesogenic environmental factors in childhood obesity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/obr.13097&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Natural environment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built up a website about COVID-19 studies, &lt;a href=&#34;http://covid19.gisersqdai.top/en-us/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Awesome of COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;. This website was used for collecting all the resources of COVID-19 related studies and was powered by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/txd-team/docsite&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;docsite&lt;/a&gt;. Besides, I developed a dashboard shiny app about COVID-19 map, &lt;a href=&#34;https://gisersqdai.shinyapps.io/COVID19VIS/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;COVID-19 shiny app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic can cause reverse zoonoses (i.e., human–animal transmission of COVID-19). It is vital to utilize up-to-date methods to improve the control, management, and prevention of reverse zoonoses. Awareness of reverse zoonoses should be raised at both individual and regional/national levels for better protection of both humans and animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Addressing time lag and spatial limitations of SVI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bridging the BEA and urban exposome observation through SVI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a systematic review of the commonly audited built environment attributes and auditing tools, our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the state-of-the-art SVI-based auditing approaches and offer insights into future directions for development. The reliability of these audits varies depending on the type of attribute and the assessment tool used. We have learned that objective attributes, such as the presence of a sidewalk, generally yield higher reliability, while subjective assessments may be influenced by auditor biases, resulting in lower reliability. The use of standardized auditing tools, such as S-VAT, across multiple cities demonstrates the potential for improved comparability and generalizability of research findings. Considering the number of research groups that used these tools, ANC and MAPS were identified as the two most widely accepted auditing tools. Furthermore, many standardized auditing tools have been exclusively implemented in specific countries. This is often attributed to auditing of those attributes that are relevant in these particular countries, which may not necessarily align with conditions found in other nations. Consequently, this localization of attributes has resulted in higher reliability when the tools are applied in the country where they were originally developed, as compared to their performance in other countries. The varying levels of reliability for different attributes within the same tool indicate the need for further refinement and standardization of assessment criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methodology’s merits lie in the adoption of a classification of auditing aims and the integration of various built environment features, ultimately allowing researchers to better understand the relationship between urban design and public health. The broader impact of these findings can inform urban planning and policy-making efforts to promote healthier and more sustainable living environments. Achieving higher reliability in built environment audits requires a careful balance between objective and subjective attributes and the adoption of standardized tools and assessment criteria. This can lead to more robust research findings and an improved understanding of urban environments, ultimately contributing to better-informed urban planning and policy decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Landscape-Scale Simulation Analysis of Waterlogging and Sponge City Planning for a Central Urban Area in Fuzhou City, China</title>

&lt;h4 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The urban underlying surface heavily influences waterlogging. During the urbanization process, vegetation, water, and wetlands are replaced by impervious surfaces, including steel, cement, and other building materials. During the late-1990s, governments began to pay closer attention to the influence of urban underlying surfaces on storm water management. They started to develop low-impact development (LID) practices, which seek to use the landscape to control the water source and reduce the shock loads of storm water. Typical LID practices include green roofs, permeable pavements, and other green infrastructures. With the introduction of the Sponge City concept, China has gradually been introducing LID technology to improve the urban underlying surface and the spatial distribution of landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most previous research of LID analyzed simulation experiments and storm water management at the small-scale level, whereas little analysis has been done at the urban level. Moreover, few studies have considered the influence of the natural green infrastructure (NGI), which refers to landscape that is good at receiving water. Here, we analyzed the urban central area of Fuzhou City, China, using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) data to divide the urban underlying surface into NGI and non-NGI landscapes. We extracted the impervious surface from the non-NGI landscape and used the precipitation-volumetric method to simulate waterlogging scenarios. We determined the area of rainwater submersion by simulation experiments, the change in the NGI landscape by overlaying images of the region, and the association between these features by data mining. Using the change in ecology indices, we ascertained the changing spatial patterns of the NGI landscape and used these findings to formulate suggestions for Sponge City planning in Fuzhou. Overall, our work combines three research themes, urban waterlogging, landscape ecology, and data mining, for a deep analysis of the relationship between the NGI landscape and storm runoff in an urban environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an area was submerged, then the probability that the area was converted landscape was 21.2%. If an area was not subject to landscape conversion, then the probability that it would not be a submerged area was 99.2%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;CONCLUSIONS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the results of this study, we derived the following conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simulation analysis for the central urban area of Fuzhou City, assuming a 100-year storm with rainfall durations of 2 and 4 hours, resulted in submerged depths (areas) of 3.943 m (1.345 km2) and 4.055 m (6.032 km2), to which 12,840 and 46,460 people, respectively, were exposed. Submerged areas were found at locations of stronger human activity, which caused a higher risk of waterlogging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The area covered by NGI landscape in the central urban area of Fuzhou City decreased considerably and became more fragmented from 2006 to 2014. Urban residential area covers 40% of the converted landscape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Results of association rule mining showed that the submerged area has an important relationship with the NGI landscape conversion that, in turn, makes waterlogging frequent in urban areas. We used EIC to measure the change in landscape patterns and spatial distribution of the NGI landscape. Based on the results, we identified some ecological nodes and corridors and made some suggestions related to the Sponge City planning of Fuzhou City.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Air pollution became a global concern of public health and environmental govermance, especially in the developing countries. There is the need to understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of air pollution. How to map an accurate air pollution map is the main research problem in studies of air pollution. We could explore the driver factors of air pollution based on the spatio-temmporal air pollution maps with high accuracy. We used the different methods such as spatial interpolation methods, remote sensing retrieval, machine learning and land use regression model to obatin the air pollution maps and found some interesting results. But how to intergrating the different methods is the further studies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Urban Carbon Cycle</title>
      <link>https://gisersqdai.top/mycv/project/urban-carbon-cycle/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Cities are typical sources of carbon and a focus of climate-change mitigation. Although there is great potential for reducing emissions in cities, constructing low-carbonemission cities under the carbon-emission reduction target of the 2016 Paris Agreement remains challenging as there is little scientific evidence for use by government decisionmakers. To solve this problem, we must understand the urban carbon-cycle process in greater detail and especially analyze spatiotemporal variations in carbon sources and sinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;1-carbon-sink-map&#34;&gt;1 Carbon sink map&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forest is the only exact carbon sink. How to map the accurate carbon sink maps? Firstly, we propose herein a low-cost method that combines machine learning and spatial statistics to construct a regional biomass map from non-representative sample units. Secondly, we scaled up an ecological process model to obtain the spatial distribution of regional biomass. Finally, we used some data assimilation technology by these data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.mdpi.com/forests/forests-12-01663/article_deploy/html/images/forests-12-01663-g002-550.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;2-carbon-source-map&#34;&gt;2 Carbon source map&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cities are the main sources of $CO_2$ emissions and, thus, must abate emissions responsibly. About 50% of urban $CO_2$ emissions was attributed to urban forms, mixed land use, building types, and transportation networks.  It is necessary to characterize the pixel-based distribution of urban direct $CO_2$ emissions accurately. But large uncertainties was found at the urban scale, it&amp;rsquo;s important to analyze the uncertainties of $CO_2$ emissions gridded map at the urban scale. Besides, exlporing the relationship between $CO_2$ emissions and urban form is useful for planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used a general hybrid approach based on global downscaled and bottom-up elements to produce the CO$_2$ emissions gridded maps, identitfied the urban functional districts map, and generated the city-scale effect related impact factors. All the maps were included in a spatial database. Detailed information can see &lt;a href=&#34;http://science.gisersqdai.top/DIB/DIBdata.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;3-the-relation-between-co-2-emissions-and-urban-form&#34;&gt;3 The relation between CO$_2$ emissions and urban form&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the spatial or temporal distribution of carbon cycle including carbon sink and source is the key to design low-carbon city development policy. We compared the relationships between urban form fragmentation and CO$_2$ emissions in an urban system through the analytic framework composed of the Pearson correlation analysis, geographically weighted regression (GWR), and geographical detector methods with the use of multi-source data to construct the CO$_2$ emissions maps. The analytical framework can be applied to CO$_2$ emissions research in urban agglomerations, megacities, and small towns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research uses remote sensing data and downscaling interpolation to generate residential and transport (RTCE) maps in 130 m spatial resolution of urban center regions from 31 major cities in China, then investigates the relationship between 3 types of urban form indicators (Internal characteristics, external morphology, and development intensity) and RTCE through Geographical Weighted Regression method. The results reveal that urban form indicators could explain about 45.9% of RTCE. The 2D building shape indicator has the second greatest positive impact as the external morphology indicator, which complicates the influence. The internal characteristics indicators have relatively strong influences than the development intensity indicators. For instance, the influence of functional mixed entropy (FME) is the greatest positive influence and decreases exponentially with FME increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.iue.cas.cn/xwzx/kydt/202211/W020221125307842798054.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spatial-temporal data is the key to handling big data in this era. Therefore, we need to explored and improved the spatial-temporal GIS theory. On the other hand, we could used the big data to study the traditional spatial-temporal GIS theory and its applicathions such as spatial-temporal human behaviour, criminal geographical theory. Furthermore, scale effect and the modified areal unit problem(MAUP) are also the unsolved problems in geographical study. We want to improve the spatial-temporal geographical theory and its applicathions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1. Analytic framework&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the walking environment probably has a positive effect on the RST crime in H city, the greater walkability, the more RST. The effects of walking environment probably has spatial heterogeneity features both on RST and the residence probability of suspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-resolution mapping of steel resources accumulated above ground (referred to as steel stocks) is critical for exploring urban mining and circular economy opportunities. We developed an aggregative downscaling model that fuses multiple large-scale spatial datasets, including gridded population, gross domestic product (GDP), and built-up area. We demonstrated the utility of this model by using it to map steel stocks in mainland China at 1 × 1 km resolution. Our results found the steel stocks increased from 12,873 $t/km^2$ to 33,027 $t/km^2$ during 1995–2015, and four steel stocks clusters (i.e., Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei agglomeration, Yangtze River Delta, Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and Chengdu-Chongqing metropolitan) possessed over 40% of the national total in 2015, revealing an unbalanced distribution of steel stocks across China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-relationship-between-urban-blue-and-green-space-and-urban-submerged-area&#34;&gt;The relationship between urban blue and green space and urban submerged area&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the new normal period of economic transition in China, The Government came up with the concept of the Sponge City, we have some different views of sponge city planning
The research extracted the impervious surface from the non-NGI(natural green infrastructure ) landscape and used the precipitation-volumetric method to simulate waterlogging scenarios. We determined the area of rainwater submersion by simulation experiments, the change in the NGI landscape by overlaying images of the region, and the association between these features by data mining. Using the change in ecology indices, we ascertained the changing spatial patterns of the NGI landscape and used these findings to formulate suggestions for Sponge City planning in Fuzhou. Overall, our work combines three research themes, urban waterlogging, landscape ecology, and data mining, for a deep analysis of the relationship between the NGI landscape and storm runoff in an urban environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submerged areas were characterized by high population densities and high levels of human activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table 1. Simulation results of storm water scenarios&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Simulated parameter&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Scenario 1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Scenario 2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Storm intensity($L·S^{-1}·ha^{-1}$)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;163.183&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;101.847&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Runoff($L·S^{-1}$)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5.342×$10^6$&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6.668×$10^6$&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Submerged depth(m)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.943&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.055&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Maximum submerged depth(m)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.943&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.055&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Submerged area ($km^{2}$)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.345&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6.032&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main submerged area in Fuzhou included the central business district. Numbers of people exposed to the submerged areas of scenarios 1 and 2 were 12,840 and 46,460 people, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://science.gisersqdai.top/fig.3%28h%29.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1. Visual representation of simulation results for scenario 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://science.gisersqdai.top/fig.3%28i%29.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2. Visual representation of simulation results for scenario 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spatial association rule mining revealed a strong association between areas that were converted from NGI landscape and areas that were submerged in our simulations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table 2. Results of association rule mining&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Rules&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Support&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Confidence&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Lift&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Submerged=&amp;gt;Change&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.002&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.212&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.655&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Stay=&amp;gt;No Submerged&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.865&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.992&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.001&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an area was submerged, then the probability that the area was converted landscape was 21.2%. If an area was not subject to landscape conversion, then the probability that it would not be a submerged area was 99.2%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, we used multi-source data to identify the urban ecological-production-living spaces and provided some suggesstions for urban resilience simulation optimization. We developed some ArcGIS toolbox based on model builder and Python. Our results won the national third prize in the 2th big data supports spatial plannning and design competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-environmental-effect-of-urban-blue-and-green-space&#34;&gt;The environmental effect of urban blue and green space&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urban blue and green space could reduced urban heat island effect and air pollution and increase the water yield.&lt;/p&gt;
