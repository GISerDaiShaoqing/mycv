We published a paper entitled &lsquo;Built environments and obesity: A framework considering residences, commute routes, and workplaces&rsquo;. In this study, we introduced an innovative framework to explore the relationships between the built environment at various geographic contexts and obesity, including residences, commuting routes, and workplaces. <a href="../mycv/publication/cities-be-obesity">This paper</a> is now available on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264275125001428?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">Cities</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Jan. 26, 2025:</strong>
We published a paper entitled &lsquo;Heterogeneous impacts of and vulnerabilities to the COVID-19 pandemic&rsquo;. In this study, we proposed a novel 3D property valuation method using SVIs acquired from two angles, eye-level (pitch 0°) and sky-view (pitch 90°, upwards), and machine learning method to complete the 3D perspective and provide explainability of 3D HPM. We also compared different valuation models – namely Ordinary Least Square (OLS), Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), and Random Forest (RF) – using model performance metrics. Our main findings include, 1.3D variables are statistically significant, and adding them improves the model performance (R2 from 0.580 to 0.636 in GWR); 2.In the sky-view angle, the proportion of sky has a positive correlation while the presence of buildings and trees are negatively correlated with property values; 3.RF outperforms OLS and GWR with the highest $R^2$ (0.768) and the least RMSE (1669.60 $yuan/m^2$), which demonstrates its robust explainability and applicability for valuation. This study enriches the property valuation literature on the significance of the 3D variables and provides references to guide fair taxation and equal land use policy in vertically developed cities. <a href="../mycv/publication/habitati-svi-3dhpm">This paper</a> is now available on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0197397525000049?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">Habitat International</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Apr. 11, 2024:</strong>
We published a paper entitled &lsquo;Street view imagery-based built environment auditing tools: a systematic review&rsquo;. In this study, we reviewed 96 studies of BEA published before October 2023. The Google SVI was employed in 92.7% of the included studies. Manual processing of SVI was used in BEA in most studies (81.3%), while deep learning methods were mostly used in the remaining studies. Validated auditing tools were used in 71% of the studies. Streets were the most frequently audited objects (54.2%), followed by sidewalk (51%), traffic (49%), and land use (34.4%). The Active Neighborhood Checklist and Microscale Audit of Pedestrian Streetscapes were the two most widely used SVI-based BEA tools. Several key areas for improving the accuracy and reliability of SVI-based BEA were identified: building standardized datasets of built environment features for more accurate auditing, combining multi-source SVI for more comprehensive assessments, and adapting auditing tools to the contexts in developing countries. This study would contribute to a deeper understanding of built environmental influences on health, and facilitate informed decision-making in urban planning and public health efforts. <a href="../mycv/publication/ijgis-bea-review">This paper</a> is now available on <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13658816.2024.2336034" target="_blank">International Journal of Geographical Information Science</a>.</p></li>

We published a paper on a bikeability evaluation framework by combining the collected multi-source spatio-temporal geospatial big data. We propose a framework that comprises four sub-indices: safety, comfort, accessibility, and vitality. Utilizing open-source data, advanced deep neural networks, and GIS spatial analysis, the framework eliminates subjective evaluations and is more efficient and comprehensive than prior methods. The experimental results on Xiamen, China, demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in identifying areas for improvement and enhancing cycling mobility. The proposed framework provides a structured approach for evaluating bikeability in different geographical contexts, making reproducing bikeability indices easier and more comprehensive to policymakers, transportation planners, and environmental decision-makers. <a href="../mycv/publication/jag-bikeability-multisource">This paper</a> is now available on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569843223003631?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation</a>.

We published a paper on the development of age-sex-ethnicity-specific MetS score to redict future risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).We find that the weights of metabolic dysfunctions in the score vary across age-sex-ethnicity-specific subgroups, with higher weights for TG, HDL-C, and WC. Each unit increase in the score is associated with increased risks for hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension, and elevated levels of HbA1c, cholesterol, body mass index, and serum uric acid. The score shows high sensitivity and accuracy for detecting CVD-related risk factors and is validated in different geographical regions. Our study would advance early identification of CVD risks and, more broadly, preventive medicine and sustainable development goals. <a href="../mycv/publication/nc-mets-score-calculator">This paper</a> is now available on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-42423-y" target="_blank">Nature Communications</a>.
