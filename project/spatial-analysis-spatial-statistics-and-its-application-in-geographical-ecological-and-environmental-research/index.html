<p>Published in <em>Scientia Geographica Sinica</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
The urban space environment is an important factor for urban crimes. A greater walkability of city can reduce the crime rate in many Criminal Geography theories. However, there is few empirical studies in China. Previous studies on Criminal Geography paid more attention to the role of urban environment in crime prevention, and lack of attention to its auxiliary function of criminal investigation. This study built a multi-source spatial database by combining the theory of CPTED, Defensible Space, Criminal Behavior and Geographic Profiling. The municipal district of H city located in the southeastern coastal region of China was taken as a case study area. The Walk Score and criminal geographic targeting model were applied for the measurement. The Pearson correlation coefficient, generalized linear model, geographically weighted generalized linear regression model were used to analyze the impact of urban walking environment on robbery, snatch and theft crime (RST). The results showed that the walking environment probably has a positive effect on the RST crime in H city, the greater walkability, the more RST. The effects of walking environment probably has spatial heterogeneity features both on RST and the residence probability of suspects. There were different impacts of walking environment on the RST and the residence probability of suspects in different regions. The areas near the major transportation hubs or along the main road have great walking environment. However, they probably have more RST and higher residence probability of suspects than other places based on result of model. Although the high-grade hotels, commercial buildings and tourist attractions have great walking environment, there were low RST and the residence probability of suspects based on result of model due to the sound security and personnel access control system. This research provides a reference for prevention and investigation for robbery, snatch and theft crime.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
Regional soil quality issues arising from rapid urbanization have received extensive attention. The riverbank that runs through a city is representative of urbanization gradient transformation. Thirty soil samples in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration were collected and analyzed for the concentrations of seven analytes. Correlation, principle component analysis, cluster analysis and GeoDetector models suggested that the four groups (Cr-Ni-Cu, Cu-Zn-As-Sb, Cd and Pb) shared the same sources in the core urban region; five groups (Cr-Ni-Cu-Zn, As, Cd, Sb and Pb) in the suburbs and three groups (Cr-Ni, Cu-Zn-Cd-Sb-Pb and As) in the exurbs. GeoDetector methods not only validated the results of the three other methods, but also provided more possible impact factors. Besides the direct influences, the interaction effects among factors were quantified. Interactive combination with strong nonlinear increment changed from between-two-weak factors in the central region to between-strong-and-weak factors in the suburbs. In the exurbs, the stronger interaction effects were observed between strong and weak factors. Therefore, the GeoDetector model, which provided more detailed information of artificial sources could be used as a tool for identifying the potential factors of toxic elements and offering scientific basis for the development of subsequent pollution reduction strategies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>The impact of environmental regulation on technology innovation is a hot spot in current research where a large number of empirical studies are based on Porter Hypothesis (PH). However, there are still
controversies in academia about the establishment of “weak” and “narrow” versions of PH. Based on the panel data of application for patent of energy conservation and emission reduction (ECER) technology of Chinese city scale during 2008–2014, comprehensive energy price, pollutant emission, etc., mixed regression model and systematic generalized method of moments method were adopted, respectively, to study the impact of market-oriented and command-and-control policy tool on China’s ECER technology innovation. The results show that the environmental regulation hindered the technological innovation in the immediate phase; however, it turned out to be positive in the first-lag phase. Hence, the establishment of “weak” PH is time-bounded. The command-and-control policy tool played a more positive role in promoting technological innovation in the first-lag phase than market-oriented policy tool. Therefore, “narrow” PH is not tenable. The reason is that the main participants of China’s ECER technology innovation are state-owned companies and public institutions. Regionally speaking, the impact which command-and-control policy tool has on technological innovation at sight was nonsignificant in the eastern, the central, and the western regions of China whilst market-oriented policy tool had a negative effect. And market-oriented policy tool in the central region had strongest negative effect, which would diminish in the eastern region and become weakest in the western region. This was related to regional energy consumption level and the market economic vitality.</p>

<p>We used multi-source data to identify the urban ecological-production-living spaces and provided some suggesstions for urban resilience simulation optimization. We developed some ArcGIS toolbox based on model builder and Python. Our results won the national third prize in the 2th big data supports spatial plannning and design competition.</p>

<p>Funded by Fujian Normal University(cxxl-2014137)</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
Earthquake is a devastating natural disaster, The seismic refuge has become the research focus in the world. Status quo of Qishan campus of Fujian Normal University earthquake disaster prone and vulnerability based on, The campus network model using L-A coupled seismic refuge constrained model and the evaluation method of MCE deployment optimization research. The results are as follows. 1）The principle of combining with national disaster in earthquake emergency shelter planning based on planning, 20 earthquake emergency shelter. 2）Fujian Normal University college student population spatial distribution pattern showed uneven spatial distribution, the characteristics of the North south. Under different time scales and different obvious spatial agglomeration. 3) According to the spatial and temporal distribution of proposed model assumptions, in different time scales according to different locations of the evacuation route analysis. And the crowd under earthquake disaster evacuation of about 64.412m/min by using the MCE evaluation method and entropy method. According to the evaluation method of MCE results, the use of L-A network constraint model to evaluate campus earthquake evacuation capability. The whole campus evacuation capability is weak, scenario simulation refuge accommodate the number of students is 18638, the shelter utilization rate is only 30%. The need for further planning and construction of disaster prevention and mitigation.</p>
